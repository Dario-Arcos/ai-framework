# Discovery: {goal_name}

<!--
## Overview

Discovery output template for sop-discovery skill.
Captures problem definition, constraints, risks, and prior art before planning.

## Usage Constraints

- You MUST complete all sections because incomplete discovery leads to failed planning
- You MUST identify constraints before proposing solutions because constraints define solution space
- You MUST identify risks because unmitigated risks cause failures
- You MUST recommend spikes when uncertainty is high because spikes reduce risk
- You SHOULD identify prior art because reuse beats rebuild
- You SHOULD NOT proceed to planning with open blockers because this wastes effort

**Date**: {date}
**Status**: Discovery Complete

## Summary

**Constraints:**
- You MUST provide one-sentence goal because this focuses all subsequent work
- You MUST identify main constraint because this shapes solution space
- You MUST identify biggest risk because this guides mitigation

- **Goal**: {goal_one_sentence}
- **Main Constraint**: {main_constraint}
- **Biggest Risk**: {biggest_risk}
- **Ready for**: Planning phase

## Problem Statement

### Job to Be Done

**Constraints:**
- You MUST express as job-to-be-done because this reveals user intent
- You SHOULD NOT describe solution because this is problem space

{jtbd_answer}

### Beneficiaries

**Constraints:**
- You MUST identify who benefits because this validates need
- You SHOULD prioritize beneficiaries because not all are equal

{beneficiaries_answer}

### Success Metrics

**Constraints:**
- You MUST define measurable metrics because this enables validation
- You SHOULD NOT use vague metrics because they can't be verified

{success_metrics_answer}

---

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

**Constraints:**
- You MUST list all technical constraints because these limit solution space
- You SHOULD distinguish hard from soft constraints because they have different flexibility

{technical_constraints_answer}

### Time/Resource Constraints

{time_resource_constraints_answer}

### Non-Negotiables

**Constraints:**
- You MUST explicitly state non-negotiables because violating these means failure
- You SHOULD NOT include preferences here because non-negotiables are absolute

{non_negotiables_answer}

---

## Risks

### Technical Risks

**Constraints:**
- You MUST identify technical risks because these affect architecture
- You MUST provide mitigation for each risk because unmitigated risks are unacceptable

{technical_risks}

### Integration Risks

{integration_risks}

### Open Questions

**Constraints:**
- You MUST track open questions because they may block progress
- You SHOULD assign owners because accountability drives resolution

{open_questions_answer}

### Recommended Spikes

**Constraints:**
- You MUST recommend spikes when uncertainty is high because spikes reduce risk
- You MUST define success criteria for spikes because open-ended spikes waste time
- You MUST time-box spikes because they can expand indefinitely

{recommended_spikes}

---

## Prior Art

### Patterns to Follow

**Constraints:**
- You MUST identify reusable patterns because reuse beats rebuild
- You SHOULD reference specific examples because abstract patterns are hard to apply

{patterns_to_follow_answer}

### External Inspiration

{external_inspiration_answer}

### Anti-patterns to Avoid

**Constraints:**
- You MUST identify anti-patterns because avoiding failure modes is as important as finding success modes
- You SHOULD explain why each is an anti-pattern because context prevents accidental use

{anti_patterns_answer}

## Next Steps

1. **Review this discovery document** with stakeholders
2. **Execute recommended spikes** (if any) before planning
3. **Proceed to planning phase** using `sop-planning` skill to create detailed Problem Definition Document (PDD)
