# Example: Expo Development Build launch pattern
# CRITICAL: Never use Expo Go for E2E testing
# Run: maestro test examples/expo-dev-build.yaml

# Note: Replace com.example.myapp with your actual bundle ID
# The exp+scheme must match your app.json scheme

appId: com.example.myapp
---
# Launch via deep link (required for Expo dev builds)
- openLink: "exp+myapp://expo-development-client/?url=http://10.0.2.2:8081"

# Wait for app to fully load (longer timeout for dev builds)
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible:
      id: "app-root"
    timeout: 30000

# Take screenshot to verify launch
- takeScreenshot: "expo-launch-verified"

# Now proceed with your test flow
- assertVisible:
    id: "home-screen"
