# Signs

<!--
Signs capture learnings across iterations. Read FIRST every time.
An empty guardrails.md after multiple iterations = nothing learned.

**Signs vs Architectural Decisions**:
- Sign (here): "I hit this error" → session-scoped gotcha
- Decision (specs/design/): "We chose X because..." → permanent record

Rule: Gotcha → Sign. Decision → specs/design/.
-->

## Example Signs (Replace with your own)

### Sign: Test Framework Requires jsdom
- **Trigger**: Writing React component tests
- **Instruction**: Use `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` in jest.config.js, not 'node'

### Sign: ESM vs CommonJS Import
- **Trigger**: "Cannot use import statement outside a module" error
- **Instruction**: Check package.json `"type": "module"`. Use `.mjs` extension or configure tsconfig.

### Sign: Git Hook Did Not Commit
- **Trigger**: Pre-commit hook fails
- **Instruction**: The commit did NOT happen. Stage again and commit fresh.

## Your Signs (Add here as you learn)

<!--
### Sign: [Problem/Learning]
- **Trigger**: [When this applies]
- **Instruction**: [What to do]
