# Project: [Name]

<!--
## Overview

Project configuration template for ralph-orchestrator. Defines quality level, build commands,
validation gates, environment requirements, gotchas, and coding patterns.

## Usage Constraints

- You MUST set quality level because this determines which gates are enforced
- You MUST define all validation commands because workers need to run them
- You MUST document environment requirements because setup varies by machine
- You SHOULD document gotchas as you discover them because this prevents repeated failures
- You SHOULD NOT commit this template with example content because examples are placeholders
-->

## Quality Level

**Level: [Prototype | Production | Library]**

| Level | Shortcuts OK | Tests Required | Polish Required |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Prototype | Yes | No | No |
| Production | No | Yes | Some |
| Library | No | Yes | Yes |

**Behavior by level:**
- **Prototype**: Skip tests, skip lint, commit early and often
- **Production**: All backpressure gates must pass, TDD mandatory
- **Library**: All gates + documentation + edge cases + examples

## Build & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

## Validation

**Constraints:**
- You MUST run all gates before commit when quality level is Production or Library because this ensures code quality
- You SHOULD run gates in order (test → typecheck → lint → build) because earlier failures are more informative
- You MAY skip gates when quality level is Prototype because speed is prioritized

**All must pass before commit:**
- Tests: `npm test`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Build: `npm run build`

## Environment

- Node.js 18+
- [Other dependencies]

## Gotchas

**Constraints:**
- You MUST document problems you solve because future iterations will encounter them
- You MUST include reproduction steps because context helps diagnosis
- You SHOULD categorize by area (Environment, Build, Testing, Runtime) because this aids search

### Environment
- **Node version matters**: Use exact version from `.nvmrc`. v18 breaks crypto module.
- **M1/ARM issues**: Some native modules need `npm rebuild`. Try `arch -x86_64 npm install` if stuck.

### Build
- **Import order**: CSS imports must come after component imports or styles break.
- **Path aliases**: TypeScript paths in `tsconfig.json` need matching in `vite.config.ts`.

### Testing
- **Mock hoisting**: Jest hoists `jest.mock()` calls. Put them at file top, not inside describe blocks.
- **Async cleanup**: Always `await` cleanup in `afterEach` or you get "act()" warnings.

### Runtime
- **Hydration mismatches**: Server/client date formatting differs. Use `suppressHydrationWarning` or format on client only.
- **Memory leaks**: Event listeners in `useEffect` need cleanup. Subscriptions need unsubscribe.

## Patterns

**Constraints:**
- You MUST follow established patterns because consistency reduces cognitive load
- You SHOULD document deviations because exceptions need justification
- You SHOULD NOT create new patterns without team agreement because fragmentation hurts maintainability

### Architecture
- [Module organization]
- [State management]
- [Error handling]

### Naming
- Files: kebab-case
- Functions: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Code Organization
- `src/lib/*` - Shared utilities
- `src/components/*` - UI components
- `src/pages/*` - Page components

### Imports
- [Absolute vs relative]
- [Barrel exports]
