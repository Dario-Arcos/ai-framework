# Scratchpad

<!--
Iteration-to-iteration memory within a single loop session.
Reduces exploration overhead by recording what each iteration learned.

Read at start of EVERY iteration. Update before exit.
Cleared when loop.sh starts a new session.

## Key Decisions This Session

<!-- Record decisions so next iteration doesn't re-explore -->

## Blockers & Notes

<!-- Issues discovered, technical debt, things to watch out for -->

<!--
Update this file BEFORE exiting each iteration.
DO NOT commit scratchpad.md - it's ephemeral session state.
If loop.sh restarts, this file gets cleared automatically.
