## Build & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

---

## Validation

**Run before every commit:**

- **Tests**: `npm test`
- **Typecheck**: `npm run typecheck`
- **Lint**: `npm run lint`
- **Build**: `npm run build`

**All must pass before commit. No exceptions.**

## Operational Notes

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 18+
- [Other dependencies]
- [Environment variables needed]

### Common Gotchas
- [Framework-specific quirks discovered during development]
- [Dependency issues encountered]
- [Build configuration nuances]

### Development Workflow
- [Branch naming conventions]
- [Commit message format]
- [PR requirements]

---

## Codebase Patterns

### Architecture
- [Pattern: How modules are organized]
- [Pattern: How state is managed]
- [Pattern: How errors are handled]

### Naming Conventions
- [Files: kebab-case, PascalCase, etc.]
- [Functions: camelCase, snake_case, etc.]
- [Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, etc.]

### Code Organization
- `src/lib/*` - Shared utilities (prefer consolidation here)
- `src/components/*` - Reusable UI components
- `src/pages/*` - Page-level components
- [Other directories and their purposes]

### Testing Patterns
- [How to structure test files]
- [Mocking patterns used]
- [Test data location]

### Import Patterns
- [Absolute vs relative imports]
- [Barrel exports usage]
- [Third-party import grouping]

## Notes for Ralph

- **Don't assume not implemented** - Always search `src/lib/*` and test files first
- **Consolidate in lib/** - If utility is used 2+ times, move to src/lib/
- **Tests explain behavior** - Read tests to understand expected functionality
- **Follow existing patterns** - Match style and structure of surrounding code

---

## Progress Tracking

**NOT in this file.** Progress tracking belongs in:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Task status
- `progress.txt` - Session learnings

This file is for **how to operate the project**, not **what's been done**.
