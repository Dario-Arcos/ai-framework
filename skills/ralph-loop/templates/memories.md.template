# Memories

<!--
Persistent learnings across ralph loop sessions. Unlike Signs (guardrails.md),
memories persist indefinitely and capture patterns, decisions, and fixes.

Read at start of EVERY iteration. Update in planning mode only.
-->

## Patterns

<!-- Recurring approaches, conventions, architecture patterns -->

### mem-example-a1b2
> This project uses the Repository pattern for data access. All database queries go through `src/repositories/`.
<!-- tags: architecture, data-access | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## Decisions

<!-- Architecture choices, tech selections, design decisions -->

### mem-example-c3d4
> Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because: (1) relational data model fits better, (2) team has more SQL experience, (3) ACID compliance required for financial data.
<!-- tags: database, architecture | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## Fixes

<!-- Solutions to problems encountered that should be remembered -->

### mem-example-e5f6
> The CI pipeline fails silently if `NODE_ENV` is not set. Always export NODE_ENV=test before running tests in CI.
<!-- tags: ci, testing, environment | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## Context

<!-- Confessions and accountability records -->

### mem-example-g7h8
> confession: objective=[add user authentication], met=[Yes], evidence=[tests pass, login flow works, PR merged]
<!-- tags: confession | created: 2026-01-01 -->

When to Add:
- Discovered architectural decision not in docs
- Found undocumented API or integration pattern
- Learned team coding preferences
- Identified performance considerations
- Found deployment or CI/CD requirements

When NOT to Add (use Signs instead):
- Temporary workarounds
- Session-specific bugs
- One-time gotchas
