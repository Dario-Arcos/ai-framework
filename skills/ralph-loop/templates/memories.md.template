# Memories

<!--
## Overview

Persistent learnings across ralph loop sessions. Unlike Signs (guardrails.md),
memories persist indefinitely and capture patterns, decisions, and fixes.

## Usage Constraints

- You MUST read this file at start of EVERY iteration because memories provide essential context
- You MUST update in planning mode only because workers should not modify shared state
- You MUST use memory ID format: mem-[unix-timestamp]-[4-char-hash] because this ensures uniqueness
- You MUST include tags and creation date because this enables search and audit
- You SHOULD capture architectural decisions because these are hard to rediscover
- You SHOULD NOT add temporary workarounds because these belong in Signs (guardrails.md)
- You SHOULD NOT duplicate information in docs because memories supplement, not replace

## Patterns

<!-- Recurring approaches, conventions, architecture patterns -->

### mem-example-a1b2
> This project uses the Repository pattern for data access. All database queries go through `src/repositories/`.
<!-- tags: architecture, data-access | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## Decisions

<!-- Architecture choices, tech selections, design decisions -->

### mem-example-c3d4
> Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB because: (1) relational data model fits better, (2) team has more SQL experience, (3) ACID compliance required for financial data.
<!-- tags: database, architecture | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## Fixes

<!-- Solutions to problems encountered that should be remembered -->

### mem-example-e5f6
> The CI pipeline fails silently if `NODE_ENV` is not set. Always export NODE_ENV=test before running tests in CI.
<!-- tags: ci, testing, environment | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## Context

<!-- Confessions and accountability records -->

### mem-example-g7h8
> confession: objective=[add user authentication], met=[Yes], evidence=[tests pass, login flow works, PR merged]
<!-- tags: confession | created: 2026-01-01 -->

## When to Add

- Discovered architectural decision not in docs
- Found undocumented API or integration pattern
- Learned team coding preferences
- Identified performance considerations
- Found deployment or CI/CD requirements

## When NOT to Add (use Signs instead)

- Temporary workarounds
- Session-specific bugs
- One-time gotchas
