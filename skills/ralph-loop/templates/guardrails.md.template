# Signs

<!--
## Overview

Signs capture learnings across iterations within a loop session. Read FIRST every time.
An empty guardrails.md after multiple iterations is a FAILURE - it means nothing was learned.

## Usage Constraints

- You MUST read this file FIRST at every iteration because signs prevent repeated mistakes
- You MUST add signs when you discover gotchas because this captures institutional knowledge
- You MUST use the Sign format (Trigger + Instruction) because consistency enables search
- You SHOULD categorize signs by area because this aids discovery
- You SHOULD NOT duplicate memories here because signs are session-scoped, memories are permanent
- You SHOULD NOT leave this file empty after multiple iterations because that indicates learning failure

## Example Signs (Remove and replace with your own)

### Frontend Examples

### Sign: Test Framework Requires jsdom
- **Trigger**: Writing React component tests
- **Instruction**: Use `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` in jest.config.js, not 'node'

### Sign: Recharts Needs Client Component
- **Trigger**: Using Recharts in Next.js App Router
- **Instruction**: Add 'use client' directive - Recharts requires browser APIs

### Backend Examples

### Sign: Connection Pool Exhaustion
- **Trigger**: Database queries timing out after many iterations
- **Instruction**: Always close connections in finally block. Use `pool.end()` in cleanup.

### Sign: ESM vs CommonJS Import
- **Trigger**: "Cannot use import statement outside a module" error
- **Instruction**: Check package.json `"type": "module"`. Use `.mjs` extension or configure tsconfig.

### Tooling Examples

### Sign: Path Encoding in Claude Data
- **Trigger**: Working with `~/.claude/projects/` directory names
- **Instruction**: Directory names use dash-encoding: `-Users-foo-bar` = `/Users/foo/bar`

### Sign: Git Hook Bypassing Build
- **Trigger**: Pre-commit hook fails but changes were already committed
- **Instruction**: The commit did NOT happen when hook fails. Stage again and commit fresh.

### Pattern Examples

### Sign: Race Condition in Parallel Tests
- **Trigger**: Tests pass individually but fail when run together
- **Instruction**: Tests sharing database/state need isolation. Use unique IDs or run serially.

### Sign: Environment Variable Not Found
- **Trigger**: Works locally but fails in CI
- **Instruction**: Check CI secrets config. Local `.env` not committed. Add to CI secrets.

## Your Signs (Add here as you learn)

<!--
## Sign Format

**Constraints:**
- You MUST include Trigger because this defines when the sign applies
- You MUST include Instruction because this tells what to do
- You SHOULD be specific in triggers because vague triggers are useless
- You SHOULD keep instructions actionable because theory doesn't help in the moment

### Sign: [Problem/Learning]
- **Trigger**: [When this applies]
- **Instruction**: [What to do]
