# Board layout

Nearly all views in Linear can be shown in board layout in addition to list view.

![Linear app showing the board layout](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/04115ca5eb44c3c6fc38d9998e6a7af068cb8b61-3424x1920.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Configure⁠

You can toggle on board layout with the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl B. Alternatively, you can switch between board or list layout using the board and list icons next to Display options.

Cmd/Ctrl B to switch to board layout (or back to list)

X to select one issue

Shift X or or Shift Click to select multiple issues

Option/Alt Shift Up or Down  to move a selected issue to the top or bottom of the column

T to toggle the collapse or expansion of a swimlane



Click on Board icon to the left of View Options and select board layout on most views

Create issue by clicking the + sign at the top of a column to create an issue in that column.

Hide a column by clicking the more menu (three dots). Unhide a column by scrolling to the right-most column. Filter to show only specific columns or toggle off the View Option Show empty groups to hide empty columns.

## Basics⁠

### Feature parity⁠

Functionality and keyboard shortcuts are almost exactly the same on board and list views with a few exceptions.

- Board views and List view cannot be ordered independently. If a List view is ordered by priority for example, Board view will be ordered the same way.
- Board views to default to grouping by Status but you can click into Display options and Grouping to group by Focus, Status, Project, Priority, Cycle, Label, Label group, or SLA status (if applicable).
- When grouping by status, board views are always ordered with statuses from first to last, whereas some list views have unique ordering for statuses.
- You can hide columns in board views but in list views, you can only temporarily hide the equivalent column/grouping option by using filters. You can then make a custom view if you'd like these filters to be permanent.

The same shortcuts work to select issues in the board view, such as X to select specific issues and Shift X or Shift Click to select multiple.

### Hide columns⁠

Hide columns you don't need by selecting Hide from the column menu (three dots). Hidden columns will show up as the last column on your board. Drag issues into hidden columns without having to unhide them.

### Move to top or bottom⁠

To avoid dragging issues up or down long columns, use keyboard shortcuts instead. Option/Alt Shift Up will move issues to the top of a column whereas Option/Alt Shift Down will move it to the bottom. By default, when you move issues to a new column on a board, it will go to the top if you make the change with the keyboard shortcut S or command menu and to wherever you placed it if you used the mouse.

### Navigating columns⁠

Board views with multiple columns can be scrolled horizontally by holding Shift and scrolling vertically, or using horizontal scroll if your device supports it (like on a trackpad or Magic Mouse).

Alternatively, click and pull an empty space in the board to scroll horizontally.

### Swimlanes⁠

Board and list views have the option to display an extra dimension for visualising your projects or issues in lanes or rows on a board view, commonly known as swimlanes in project management. These sub-grouping options are especially useful for a high-level overview of the company's progress or resource allocation. You can sort by columns, group those columns and lay them out as rows for your chosen dimension such as teams, cycles, assignee, lead, initiative or project health to name a few.These lanes can be collapsed or expanded for further visual clarity in board view.

## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/board-layout#collapsible-176f91fdf6d7)Unfortunately, you can't set board view as a universal default. However, a user can choose board layout in a view and then select view options and set as default to ensure board layout is the default for that view for anyone who visits that one view. This won't prevent other members from changing this and setting a new default afterwards though.

[](https://linear.app/docs/board-layout#collapsible-5873931a4fdf)It is not possible to select board layout in split views like Inbox or Triage.

[](https://linear.app/docs/board-layout#collapsible-0ca63e2dc0c9)Descriptions are not shown on cards. If an issue has many properties, not all properties may have space to be display on the card.

Use Space while hovering your cursor over a card to peek for more detail, or open the issue to see all properties.

# Timeline

Display projects chronologically to track their progress, deadlines, and dependencies over time

![Timeline view](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6a5478c3bc2de4eae7b848954548c9ddb2b0f53c-4460x2868.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Timeline views are a project planning tool that allows you to visualize and manage projects across time. It's specifically designed to only surface projects to keep project planning work cleanly separated from granular issue implementation.

## Accessing Timeline View⁠

![Display options for Timeline](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/8686590213182d689d4ad2afd39c2e3d81164f3a-413x146.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

- Navigate to any Project view
- Click on Display dropdown
- Select Timeline view

## How to use Timeline view⁠

### Product roadmap planning⁠

- Use the timeline view for high-level project planning and roadmap visualization
- Use milestones to mark important in-project checkpoints
- Set project dependencies between related projects to maintain proper sequencing
- Set your view to week, month, quarter, or year to adjust your preferred level of detail.

### Launch planning⁠

- Gain visibility into what’s shipping and when.
- Plan more effectively across product, engineering, and align on launch timings with GTM

### Cross-team project coordination⁠

- Regularly update project timelines to reflect current status
- Select a team's cycle to be viewable on the Timeline. Refer to "Timeline customization" below.

### Resource planning⁠

# Custom Views

Create durable filtered views of issues, projects, or initiatives that you can save and share with others in your workspace.

Initiative views are available on Enterprise plans.

![Issue and Project Views](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6588c3dbdde8688ffd192a47210980e8e1a3c4fc-2494x1021.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Create custom views using filters to show only the items you want to see. Save, share and favorite these views for easy access and faster team collaboration.

## Basics⁠

### Open views⁠

Open views in the team or workspace Views pages in your sidebar, or search for views to open with O then V.

### Create views⁠

To build a custom view from scratch, click on Views in the sidebar, select the type of view you wish to create (Issue, Project, or Initiative on Enterprise plans) and click New view.

You can also save any filtered board or list as a custom view with the keyboard shortcut Option/Alt V or by clicking on the Save view icon. The icon appears next to the Display Options icon after you've add at least one filter to any team-specific list or board.

### Edit views⁠

To edit an existing view, click on the view name from within the view itself and  choose the Edit view… option in the pop-up menu. You also have the option to duplicate an existing view from here, just click on the Duplicate view... option.

### Share views⁠

![Share view](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/866f7257d57e24abaeb6ff6c8a613fc2f57eeca7-1998x850.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

If a shared view is created at the workspace level, then the view will appear under Workspace views on the Views page. If you select a specific team when creating the view, then only members of that team will see the shared view and it will be listed under Team views in the View page. To share a view across multiple teams but limit it to projects or issues within a specific team or teams, create an All teams view and use filters to refine the list.

### Create views attached to Teams or Projects⁠

![+ Create new view button next to All Issues, Active and Backlog views](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/f8bbfb68fe973ab9e7de98fc8b8a7318653aff17-800x218.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

From your team's Issues and Projects sections, you can create new views to appear alongside the team's default views. These will be visible to all members of the team. Use the + Create new view button beside the default or existing views to create additional views here.

### Copy view link⁠

To share a specific view in Slack or wherever you discuss work, copy a link by clicking the custom view's three dot (more) menu and selecting Copy view URL or by copying the View's URL in the browser. Sharing a link does not automatically give anyone access to a view, it must be shared first.

### Favorite views⁠

Favorite views that you access frequently to add them to your sidebar. Do this by clicking on the star next to the view name or from the overflow menu. Favoriting custom views lets you select them as your default page when opening Linear in Settings > Account > Preferences.

### Collapse view group headers⁠

Expand or collapse group headers when in list view by hovering over the group and pressing t, or clicking on the toggle icon at the left side of the group header.

### View sidebars⁠

The righthand sidebar clarifies the view's contents and allows you to quickly filter for common properties. Project view sidebars display information on those project's leads, teams, projects, initiatives and health. Issue view sidebars display assignees, labels and projects.

![Shows view sidebar on an issue view, with a quick filter option on hover state for assignees](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/128bab75f8039c255acfb3ca833c057153ed2e1e-2160x1326.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Issue view subscriptions⁠

Configure personal or Slack channel notifications when an issue meets parameters defined by a view, or when an issue in a view is completed/canceled.

Click the bell icon at the top of an issue view. Select whether you'd like to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, marked completed or canceled, or both.

To reduce notification noise, you won't receive notifications in views you subscribe to for actions you take yourself.

Once you've configured a view subscription, manage the subscription in notification settings.

Click the bell icon at the top of a view, then the Configure button next to Slack notifications. Turn on the toggle and authorize Linear to post to a particular channel. Choose whether to be notified for when an issue is added to the view, completed/canceled, or both.

Moving forwards, notifications for these selected changes will be sent as messages to the chosen Slack channel.

### View owners⁠

Every view has an owner property visible in that View's dedicated sidebar as well as on the main Views page in Linear's main sidebar. This field defaults to the creator of the view but can be changed to other users as desired. Before deleting a view, we advise checking in with its owner to ensure it's no longer needed.

[](https://linear.app/docs/custom-views#collapsible-034a76e781ed)If you want to curate a list of projects for planning purposes that map to an organization goal or objective and you want to keep track of overall progress, an initiative is the ideal tool. The projects in an initiative are manually curated and do not change over time unless new projects are manually added or removed.

In Project views, any projects meeting the view's filter criteria will appear. Use project views to represent the current state of work, or as a quick way to keep an eye on particular types of projects you care about.

# User views

See views that show you how work is distributed across your team.

![Image showing all the issues assigned to a particular team member in Linear which are displayed after clicking into their profile.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6d01443d6a4f5e02ea2722359bb6a9eba458ad7b-942x505.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

You'll often want to create a view that shows issues assigned to one or more members of your team. There are a few ways that we make this visible: user profiles, assignee grouping, filter by assignee, and the cycle sidebar.

O then U to open a user profile

- Click your avatar to view your profile
- Click on a user's name in activity items to view their profile

open user to open user profile

open profile to open your user profile

## Basics⁠

### User profiles⁠

To see a view of all issues assigned to a specific user, you can open up a user profile. The easiest way to do this is with the shortcut O then U, which will show a list of all users in your workspace. Select a user to go to their profile where you'll easily see their assigned issues (top bar next to their name) and can filter or scan the list. You can also access user profiles by clicking on a user avatar in the activity feed.

### Custom Views⁠

If you'd like to have a view show the assigned issues of multiple users, or if you'd like to change the view's parameters, custom views are more flexible than user profiles.

### Filter and Group⁠

Most views supporting grouping by assignee. If you want to see distribution of remaining work in a project for example, you can group by assignee and then filter by Started and Unstarted statuses.

### Cycle sidebar⁠

From any cycle view, use Cmd/Ctrl I to open a sidebar that shows the cycle details, graph, and distribution of work across the team. Next to each user's name, you'll see a total issue or estimate count for their issues in that cycle as well as the percentage completion. Hover over a specific user's name to filter the list or board view down to their issues only.

# Peek preview

View issue details without having to open issues.

![Linear app showing how to peek issues](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/5205025fbe6e96bf749f76d5e1cad30b484f8b50-1052x634.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Peek is one of the semi-secrets of the Linear UI. It lets you view details of focused issues at a glance from any list or board view, similar to Quicklook in macOS.

Tap Space to toggle peek on or off

Space and hold to turn on peek only while Space is depressed

Peek can only be launched with the keyboard shortcut

Peek can only be launched with the keyboard shortcut

## Configure⁠

Peek is a default setting in Linear available on many issue and project views. If peek is available for your page or view, you can launch it by pressing the Space bar and turn it off by pressing the Space bar again. To temporarily turn it on, hold the Space bar down. Peek will remain active until you let go of the Space bar.

## Basics⁠

Press Space to launch peek, then scroll through a list or board with (J/K or ↑/↓) to launch the peek pop up. The peek preview will show information based on the items

- For issues, it will show a preview issue details including the description, assignee, status, priority, cycle, labels, estimate, creation date, and updated date.
- For projects, peek will show project details as well as the project graph.

## Quick look⁠

When you have projects or issues in view in the Cmd/Ctrl + K menu, get a preview without opening it by using quick look -- a variation on peek. When available, this is triggered by the right arrow key and adds a preview to the right side of the command menu.

# Label views

Label views show all issues under a specific label or label group.

![Linear label page for a label titled "idea"](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/dc574c10f8662331f1453c0037dbbd03a0d16291-1998x731.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Label views show you all the issues associated with a label.

O then L to open a label view

Click on a label from an issue, board, or list to open the label view

open label to open a label view

## Basics⁠

To open a label view, click on the label or label group from a board, list, or issue view. You can also use O then L to launch a menu and select the label view. You can favorite label views as well as filter them. Team-specific label views only show issues in the specific team associated with the label, whereas workspace label pages show issues associated with the label from all teams.

### Workspace labels⁠

If multiple teams have a a team-specific label (e.g. Design), and you want to view all issues with the same label across these teams, it is possible to use filters and custom views to do so.

To set this up, create an All teams view, then apply a filter for the specific label. Make sure the label is spelled exactly the same across all teams, though capitalization and label color don't matter.

# Team pages

Linear teams contain default views to organize issues and projects.

![Linear app showing the default views](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/b1a6167dbef0d7f836ea9637071a199adbb01945-1592x669.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Teams on your sidebar have the following pages:

- Triage (when enabled)
- Issues
- Cycles (when enabled)CurrentUpcoming
- Projects
- Views

Archived issues can be found under the ...  menu when hovering over a Team name or by using the keyboard shortcut g followed by x.You can access views from the sidebar or with keyboard shortcuts.

G then A to go to active issues

G then B to go to backlog

G then E to go to all issues

G then X to go to archived issues

G then C to go to all cycles view

G then V for current cycle

G then W for upcoming cycleCmd/Ctrl B to switch to board layout (or back to list)

O then T to switch between teams, then use shortcuts to get to that team's views

Go to default team views from the sidebar

view name to go to that view

open team or Ctrl Shift 1-9 to go to a different team, then access that team's views

## Issues⁠

The Issues page shows all issues across the selected team that are not archived or deleted. This includes completed and canceled issues. There are default views within this page for Active issues and Backlog issues.

### Active⁠

Active shows all active issues on your team, which are the issues under Unstarted or Started categories in your team's workflow. If you're using our default states, these would include To Do and In Progress but not Backlog, Completed, or Canceled issues. Navigate to your team's active issues by hitting G then A.

### Backlog⁠

This includes issues in backlog, which is our default status for newly created unstarted issues. Navigate to your team's backlog issues by hitting G then B.

One backlog status exists by default but you can add more statuses in this group through team settings (e.g. Icebox). Any issues here will be updated to active (To do) status if they're moved to a cycle. You can also enable a cycle setting to automate the reverse: if issues are moved out of a cycle, they'll move to the backlog. See cycles under team settings for more information.

### Archive⁠

![Team archives](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/df7144571049827c598576a0a9d3afef7eac8af8-694x356.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Your team's archive page contains all archived issues, projects, and cycles for the team as well as recently deleted items. Archived items are kept for historical reference and can be restored anytime using the # shortcut. Issue links will still work even if the issue has been archived or is awaiting deletion but issues and projects must be unarchived in order to make changes to them. Deleted items are permanently removed 14 days after deletion.

![Team archives](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/686161368246b7432ebe1dbcd20338e5ef2c63b7-1814x174.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Navigate to your team's archives page by clicking on the three dots next to your team's name in the sidebar and selecting Open archives... or use the keyboard shortcut G then X.

## Cycles⁠

The Cycles page displays current, future, and past (unarchived) cycles and and shows some high level overview for you to compare between cycles. Click into any cycle here to view cycle issues and graphs. Past cycles will be archived according to the settings in auto-archive.

Current cycle opens the current cycle and Upcoming opens the next cycle.

## Projects⁠

Projects shows all projects what are assigned to the team.

## Views⁠

See existing custom views created for your team or workspace. You can also create new issue or project views from here.

# Search

Quickly find issues, projects and documents with Search.

![Linear search page](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/440cb0c4bf90cd1b66d95a54faed35c951c85fbc-2062x1165.heif?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Use the shortcut / to open Search. Search retrieves issues, projects, and documents across your workspace.

Use O + I to search for issues specifically by title or identifier.

/ to search all issues in workspace by title, description, comments

Cmd/Ctrl F to search issue titles in the current view (board, list, Inbox)

O then I to view recently opened issues

O then I to quick search issues by issue ID or title





- Select the button with the magnifying glass from the sidebar next to the New Issue button to search all issues in workspace by title, description, comments
- Searching boards, lists, or the Inbox must be done using the keyboard shortcut or command line
- Select the clock button in the top bar (next to the arrow buttons) to open recent issues or find a list of recent issues under the workspace search

find in view to search issue titles in the current view (board, list, Inbox)

open issue to launch quick issues search

issue ID then Enter to open any issueType i followed by space to focus your command menu on issue results

Additionally, you can type p followed by space for projects, u for users, t for team, l for labels, f for favorites and d for documents.

## Basics⁠

### Search workspace⁠

Click on the search button in the top left or type / to open the quick search menu and then type your query. Search looks for issues and documents across the full workspaces and matches the issue ID or terms in the title, description, or comments. You can search by ID exactly e.g. LIN-123 or shorthand e.g. lin123. The search term will be highlighted if it's in the title.

We sort search results in what we assume is the most relevant order, showing unstarted and in progress issues first, then backlog, completed, canceled, and archived issues.

To further refine your search, use operators like:

- "keyword" to search for an exact term. Without quotes, searches may also include results for similar terms.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c377a88c314fd6d0ceacf255f927c3220f1d9a07-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

ProTip: Use filters to refine search results. Apply them after entering the search by clicking the search icon in the upper left using Cmd/Ctrl F to search a view (list, board, Inbox).

### Search filters⁠

Narrow your search by @-mentioning teams, users, status, and other properties. This will automatically create and apply a filter to your search. Apply additional filter options through the Filter menu.

![quick search filter by assignee, executed by typing @ma to show @matthijs, @marcos as options](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/3079a62c088cf8b137d4d02c19a50f63780f26da-2108x1030.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Recent issues⁠

When you open the search menu, you'll be shown recent searches as well as a list of recent issues for easy access. You can also find recent issues on the macOS desktop app by clicking the clock icon above the lefthand sidebar or launching it with O then I.

### Search specific views⁠

Type Cmd/Ctrl F to search for issues within the current view. The search bar will appear in the top right corner next to the Display Options button. You'll need to search by exact issue ID or words in the title. This search acts more like a temporary filter, so as you type, only matching issues remain on the board or list. Press Esc to clear the search and show all of your issues.

### Quick search⁠

The shortcut O then I will open a recent issues search where you can also search for issues by issue ID or title. This supports partial word search but will only search by title (not description or comments).

# Filters

Filters allow you to refine existing views and create custom views to show only the relevant issues.

![Linear interface showing filters applied to the active issues view](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/26e1e266d76606fad8972baf4b57ed364aa2e4c1-2438x1126.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Our powerful filtering system lets you refine issue lists down to just the issues you need to work on. You can apply filters to almost every view in Linear and filter by almost any issue property. You can also apply various operators to filters and combine filters to show any or all.

F to open filter menu, then type to select filter type and name or quick filter by typing the name directly

Press F again to add additional filters. To refine operators on existing filters, use the mouse.

Backspace/delete to clear filters if filter panel is focused

Option/Alt V to save as custom View

- Click the Filter button in the top bar to filter any view
- Click the X on a filter to remove it
- Click the button in the top right next to View Options that appears on filtered views to create a custom View

filter then filter type then select specific filters. To refine operators on existing filters, use the mouse.



## Basics⁠

### Apply filters⁠

Type F to select filters from the command menu or click the Filter button above the board or list. You'll see a menu of filters that you can apply to the current view along with the number of matching issues.  Once you've opened the filter menu, you can move through the menu or use free text search to find the exact filter you need.

### Filter categories⁠

You can filter by the following properties in Linear:

There are a few edge cases with workarounds:

- To filter for no labels, you'll have to select all labels and then switch the operator to does not include.
- To filter by milestones, filter by project first.
- You cannot filter for suspended users. To find issues assigned to or created by suspended users, navigate to their profile page (linear.app/workspace-name/profiles/username). If you do not know the username, an admin can find the link by clicking on the user's photo or name on the Members list.

### Quick search filters⁠

If you know the specific name of the property you want to filter, you can type that directly and the filter will show up as a choice, saving you from having to click through the category to select it.

### Filter with AI⁠

Use natural language combined with artificial intelligence to filter your views. For example filter by phrases like "Show me issues assigned to me", "What issues are important?", " what issues are due next week" and so on, to have your views automatically filtered with the most suited parameters.



![Linear interface showing AI filters menu](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/f2f4e2653379d8211c581e5a946d037b7c4cfd8e-848x405.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Build with operators⁠

Once you add a filter, refine it with operators. The filter type cannot be changed but clicking on any other part of the filter formula will give you options to change it and modify the query.

For instance, for a filter that says Assignee is Andreas, clicking on Assignee will do nothing, clicking on is will give you the option to change the operator to is not, and clicking on Andreas will show a selectable list to modify the assignee. If you add another assignee, Adrien, then you'll see the is operator change to is either of or is not.

We support the following operators in Linear, which will show up depending on the type of filter and selections:

- is or is not when one option is included in the filter
- is either of or is not when multiple options are included in the filter
- includes any, all, neither, either, or none for labels and links
- before or after for date-related filters

### Combined filters⁠

Show results that match any or all filters applied to a view. Once you add at least two filters, the option will appear in the top right sidebar. Click on the all filters or any filters wording to switch it.

### Create Views⁠

Once you've applied at least one filter to a view, you'll see a button in the top right appear that lets you create a View from the custom filters. If you click it (or use the shortcut Option/Alt V), you'll be taken to the View editor with those filters already applied. Learn more about Views.

### Filterable views⁠

Almost every view in Linear can be filtered with a few exceptions:

### Filter with API⁠

For more complex filters or to build queries on the API, see our developer documentation.

# Display options

Display options let you group and order issues and projects to determine which information appears in your view.

![Image showing the upper right corner of the roadmap view and the view options. These include the layout, zoom and ordering options and the options to choose whether completed projects and empty milestones are shown.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/9723099db6c7913608fcdc59be40a27a33e528a4-1203x939.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Display options appear on every view in Linear. On issue views, they allow you to order and group issues in various ways, switch between board and list layouts, and choose which information is displayed. On project and initiative views, they control the layout between timeline and list views as well the grouping and ordering of information. Display options can be saved as personal preferences or as the default display options on that page for your workspace.

Shift V to open display options

Cmd/Ctrl B to toggle between list and board on issue views

- Select the Display options button that shows up on the top right corner of a view. If the view does not have Display options, it is not supported for that view.
- To update for your view only, simply modify the display options (do not Set as default).
- Press Set as default to save the current display options as the default for other members in your workspace. It will be the view they see when they first open it, but they can always apply their own preferences on top of it.
- Press Reset to default to revert back to the default (Saved) display options.

"Show display options"

## Basics⁠

### Saving display options⁠

To update your view only, customize the view and then navigate away from the options menu by clicking anywhere in the app. Your selections will persist even if you navigate away from the current view.

To update the display options on that page for your whole workspace, press Set as default after customizing the view. This will apply the configuration to every other user in your workspace.

If you customize a view's display options and wish to return to the default configuration, Click Reset to default.

### Available display options⁠

Every view in Linear is slightly different and will display different display options. Triage and Inbox only let you update the ordering and not grouping properties. We'll work to expand display options over time.

### Issue view⁠

#### Layout⁠

If a board is available for your view, you'll see the option and can toggle between lists and boards.  Cmd/Ctrl B will also toggle the layout.

#### Grouping⁠

Grouping is allowed in most list views and lets you group issues by Status, Assignee, Project, Priority, Cycle or Focus*. No grouping removes all categorization and is especially useful when applying ordering and filters. Grouping settings will affect whether you can order issues manually.Beside each group in board or list view, you will see either the total number of issues in the group or the total estimate of all issues in the group. You can click this to toggle between either option.

*Focus is available in the My Issues view. Focus is a unique grouping that attempts to organize issues assigned to you in order of what you'd want to work on first.

#### Sub-grouping⁠

Sub-grouping is available in lists and boards (as rows). In board view having rows helps for a swim-lane style structure common in project management.

The grouping header will remain sticky as you scroll down so it's clear what grouping and sub-grouping you have in these views.You can drag and drop issues between each grouping and it will automatically adopt the properties of that grouping.

#### Ordering⁠

Ordering is allowed in most list views and lets you order issues within their groupings by a number of properties, including Status, Manual, Priority, Last created, Last updated, Due date, and Link count. You can also reverse the sort order of your issues, except when sorting manually or by status.

#### Manual ordering⁠

Manual ordering is default for board views and can be selected in most list views. To move issues around, select them with your mouse and drag them to a new position. Manual ordering is unique in that it will update the manual order for everyone in the workspace.

#### Sub-issues⁠

Toggle this setting on to show sub-issues in the list or off to only show parent issues and issues without sub-issues.

#### Show empty groups⁠

When toggled, this setting will hide groupings without any issues.

#### Display properties⁠

Choose what issue properties are displayed on individual issues on lists or the board. This is different from filters; filters will refine the list to only issues with certain properties while display options show all issues in the list but hide or show data on the issue item or board card.

Display properties include Issue ID, Priority, Status, Labels, Project, Cycle, Created, Updated, Assignee, Estimate, Links, Time in status, Sentry issues, and Pull Requests and Commits. On Business and Enterprise plans, SLA is also a supported Display property.

## Initiatives and project views⁠

#### Layout⁠

Switch between list view and timeline view.

#### Ordering⁠

Order projects manually, or by properties like status, priority or updated or created time. You can group by lead, member, status, health, start date, and target date in initiatives or in project views. You can also group by initiatives in project views.

You can reverse the sort order of your projects, except when sorting manually or by status.

#### Zoom⁠

Zoom the timeline view to focus on a month, quarter, or year. Use the mouse (two finger swipe on Mac) to scroll backwards and forwards in time.

#### Completed projects⁠

Under the active view tab, show projects that have completed in the last week, month, or year -- even if they've been closed. You can also select to show all projects no matter the status, or no completed projects in the active view.

# Favorites

Favorite views you frequently use.

![Linear app showing a doc that is favourited](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/21619d150ec1a00878e780cf206c6dc1dc875844-1564x1018.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Favorites are personal shortcuts which appear in your sidebar.

O then F to open favorites

- Click the star next to issue, project, label, and custom views to mark or unmark favorite
- Click on favorites from the sidebar
- Hover over favorite then click X to remove it

favorite to favorite or unfavorite issue

open favorite to open favorite

## Basics⁠

### Applicable views⁠

If a view can be favorited, you'll see the outline of a star in the top bar next to the view name. You can favorite the following views in Linear:

- Issues
- Users
- Projects
- Specific Cycles
- Custom Views
- Label views
- Default views: all issues, active issues, backlog, board, current cycles, upcoming cycles.

Some views cannot be favorited, like the view of another user's issues that you see after clicking their name. Instead, you can create a custom view with filters to see the same issues, and add this to your favorites instead.

### Add favorites⁠

To favorite, select the ⭐ icon in the page header. You can also select the issue and search for the favorite command. Favorites do not always show up on contextual menus.

### Create folders⁠

To create a folder for favorites, hover over favorites and click the icon to the right to create a new folder, or create from the ⭐ icon menu. You can give it a name of your choosing and easily drag any existing favorites in or out of the folder.

### Access favorites⁠

Once you favorite an issue, you'll see a Favorites section appear in your sidebar above Your Teams. You can access favorites by clicking on them from the sidebar or searching for them in the command menu. The shortcut O then F will open a menu from which you can open a favorite, too.

### Remove favorite⁠

Hover over the favorite in the sidebar and click on the X to remove it. This is not reversible but you can easily add the favorite again by going to the issue or view and selecting the star.

# Inbox

The Inbox is your notification center in Linear and where you’ll find important updates on issues in your workspace.

![Inbox view in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/8cb10ab6d7f0be331cdfc4f3d39f20b7ce148203-1308x688.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

You'll receive an Inbox notification for key events on your subscribed issues. You are automatically subscribed to issues when you create them, are assigned them, or are mentioned in an issue description or comment.

You cannot customize which notifications go to the Inbox (they all will) but you can apply filters to focus on certain notification types. You can also customize which notifications trigger other alerts in Settings > My Account > Notifications.

## View notifications⁠

Find your Inbox in the sidebar. The fastest way to get there is with the keyboard shortcut G then I, which takes you to the Inbox from any page.

Scroll through the notifications in your Inbox using J / K or ↑ / ↓ while on the list or individual notification view.

Click into the notification to view the individual issue in a special Inbox view, from which you can take Inbox actions as well as make changes to the issue.

## Inbox actions⁠

From the list view you can take Inbox-related actions such as deleting or snoozing notifications as well as actions to update the issue properties.

Right-click over an issue to bring the contextual menu with available actions.

You can delete notifications with Backspace, delete all with Shift Backspace, or delete all read notifications by using Cmd/Ctrl D.

Select a notification and then use U to mark as read or unread, Option/Alt U to mark all issues as read or unread, and H to Snooze the issue (more below).

To unsubscribe from an issue via the Inbox view, you must click into it first and then unsubscribe use Shift S, the button in the top menu bar, or the unsubscribe option in the Activity feed.

## Quick search⁠

Press Cmd/Ctrl F to bring up the quick search bar and then type to filter the list by title, issue ID, notification type, or assignee. It'll update the list to show only issues matching that search.  For example, see only notifications where someone commented on an issue or issues that have been auto-closed by Linear. Esc will clear the search.

## Display options⁠

Open display options to update what properties are displayed on your notifications. You can toggle Show snoozed or Show read issues.

Because reminders do not hide an issue, there is no toggle in Display options regarding reminders.

![Inbox display options](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/4877ca001f9474c1dacd8b15baeaa9c4171444c3-826x522.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Snooze⁠

Snoozing temporarily hides a notification from the Inbox or Triage. At the specified time, it will re-appear as a new notification and unread.

If new activity occurs before the Snooze time, you will receive an inbox notification for the activity and the Snooze will be canceled.

You can choose to show or hide snoozed notifications in your inbox display settings.

## Issue Reminders⁠

You can also set issue reminders for an issue, document, project or initiative and receive a notification to your Inbox at the selected time.

Your scheduled reminder will show at the top of the issue and can be rescheduled or canceled as needed.

### Setting Snooze or Reminders⁠

Set a reminder on an issue or document, or snooze existing reminders:

Press H to snooze a notification from the inbox, or to set a reminder on an issue or document

From the inbox, right click an issue and select Snooze to delay the notification

Click on the display settings at the top of your inbox to show or hide snoozed issues

Click into the ... menu of an issue and choose Remind Me to set reminders

Click on an existing reminder at the top of an issue to reschedule or cancel it.



Snooze this notification to snooze an existing notification from the inbox

Remind me about this issue/document to set or edit a reminder on an issue or document

Cancel reminder to cancel a reminder you've set already

![Intervals available when setting reminders](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/0481a1b521e5ec58910e3294f94eb984c50517be-1378x755.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Custom dates

For custom dates and times, you can type in the selection instead of selecting from the calendar. Be sure to type the option in full (e.g. next quarter not next quar) otherwise the option will not appear.

- Month Date Time (e.g. Jan 3 10am)
- Next quarter
- Til or until month / date
- For X months / weeks / days

## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/inbox#collapsible-cadd5baf61b1)We don't support archiving notifications at this time but will consider it in the future.

[](https://linear.app/docs/inbox#collapsible-7a0415b7ea28)You cannot choose which notifications go to your Inbox. All notifications will arrive there, and any additional notification subscriptions you enable under Account > Notifications will link back to the Inbox notification.

[](https://linear.app/docs/inbox#collapsible-5c0001210a74)Yes, you can have up to 500 notifications in your inbox at one time. Older notifications beyond that count will not be retained.

# My issues

See your most important issues in one view.

![Linear app showing the My Issues page with the assigned tab selected](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/70c22a56e776bfbffa920091b64a28845ca8eaeb-1864x842.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

My issues is a curated view that shows your most pertinent issues. It's split into four tabs: Issues assigned to you, created by you, to which you are subscribed, and issues with recent activity.

G then M to go to My Issues

Shift S to subscribe to issues

Cmd/Ctrl Shift S to unsubscribe to issues



Find My Issues in the top left sidebar under Inbox

Open an issue then click the three dots (more menu) at the top of the Activity to subscribe or unsubscribe to it



my issues to go to my issues

## Basics⁠

### Curated priority order⁠

By default, My issues uses a unique grouping called Focus that attempts to organize issues assigned to you in order of what you'd want to work on first. Issues are grouped in the following order:

- Urgent Issues
- Issues with SLAs
- Assigned issues blocking others
- Issues in your current cycle (optional)
- Issues in future cycles (optional)
- Other active (e.g. issues in progress that do not fall into previous categories)
- Triage (optional)
- Backlog issues
- Done
- Cancelled

Within each category, issues are ordered by priority, with started issues showing first. You can change the grouping options from the display options on the top-right of the view.

### Created issues⁠

My Issues is also where you'll find a list of all the issues you've created in the workspace, ordered by creation date. This includes issues you create via integrations with Slack, support tools such as Front, Intercom, and Zendesk, and Sentry.

### Subscribed issues⁠

You're automatically subscribed to issues assigned to you, in which you've been @mentioned, and created by you. From subscribed issues (and most other places in the app), you can unsubscribe from issues individually or in bulk by selecting the issue(s) and then pressing Shift S. Do the same with Cmd/Ctrl Shift S to manage subscribers. Unsubscribe options show up in the command menu but not the contextual menu.

### Activity⁠

The activity tab will show issues with the actions below that have occurred by date.

- issue created
- issue updated
- assigned issue state changed
- issue commented
- comment reacted
- opened pull request

# Pulse

Pulse keeps you informed about your workspace's project and initiative updates.

![The main Pulse feed, and a daily summary notification of Pulse in Inbox](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/41330bb8225ae68b66fd9c1fbddceeec49da89e9-2880x1400.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Pulse is a feed of project and initiative updates in your workspace. It's available as a sidebar item when you want to read full updates as written, and as daily or weekly summaries delivered to your Inbox.

## Basics⁠

### Enable Pulse⁠

Admins can turn on Pulse for their workspace in Settings > Pulse, and set a default cadence for delivering summary notifications (Weekly on Mondays, every weekday, or never). If users customize their own schedule, they will override this default. Pulse is available on all Linear plans, but as a workspace-level concept it is not available to Guest roles.

### View Pulse⁠

Read the full text of updates from the Pulse page in your sidebar. Optionally, customize your sidebar by right clicking on to change whether Pulse always appears, only appears when badged, or never appears.

Choose a specific Pulse tab to focus on the updates you want to see. The For me tab includes projects you're a part of or may be interested in. Popular gives priority to recent updates with emoji or comment engagement. Recent displays every update organized by recency.

![A project update in Pulse](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/1013ba53963bd285d40990af87481e5a8fc9adfe-3078x1178.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Inbox notifications⁠

![example daily pulse](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c79501bd3cae279a7eb23c840111f0fa42f0f134-1490x1257.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Optionally, receive daily or weekly update summaries to your Inbox. Customize the cadence by right clicking on a Pulse inbox notification, through the Subscribe menu in Pulse, or in Preferences. Pulse updates arrive in your inbox by 7:00 AM in your local time.

These notifications contain updates for projects when

- You're a member of the project
- The project rolls up to an initiative you own
- You explicitly subscribed the project
- You're subscribed to all sub-projects for a project's initiative
- You're subscribed to all project updates from a particular team

You'll also receive Initiative updates to inbox when:

- You're the initiative's owner
- You're a member of the initiative's projects

### Custom feeds⁠

Optionally, create personal feeds in Pulse based on custom filters.

In busy workspaces with a high velocity of project and initiative updates, this can help narrow focus to a specific set of updates without needing to subscribe and unsubscribe to/from individual projects and initiatives. These feeds are only visible to you in the main Pulse page, and cannot be shared with others or subscribed to.

![Creating a new pulse view](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/2fc8c0a7242e401866b0d217cfaca474f2f2bac2-816x1062.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Pulse audio⁠

When consuming Pulse from your Inbox on desktop, web or mobile, click on the Play button to hear your summarized updates read aloud. Audio is not available in the Pulse sidebar page.

# Dashboards

Dashboards let you bring together insights from across teams and projects onto a single page. Use them to track key metrics, monitor trends, and explore data in one place.

Available to workspaces on our Enterprise plans.

![Dashboards page in a Linear workspace](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/71f0619607a00ecd4486a66340fa0ec12f38fd97-2016x1036.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Dashboards help teams stay aligned by surfacing key data in one centralized view.



You can use dashboards to:

- Track metrics across multiple teams and projects
- Combine charts, metric blocks, and tables in a single layout
- Filter each insight independently to customize what’s shown
- Explore data directly by clicking into charts and metrics

## Creating dashboards⁠

Dashboards can be created in multiple ways:



- From the Dashboards tab in the workspace Views page or a team’s Views page: Navigate to the Views page for your workspace or a team, select the Dashboards tab, and choose “New dashboard”.
- Directly from an existing insight: When viewing an Insight inside a View, open its context menu and select “Add to dashboard” to create a new dashboard or add it to an existing one.

Insights can be included on multiple dashboards.



## Using dashboards⁠

Each insight added to a dashboard can be:



- Displayed as a chart, table, or single metric
- Individually filtered to customize the data shown
- Explored directly — click into any slice or metric to view the underlying issues without leaving the dashboard

This makes dashboards useful both for high-level overviews and deeper analysis, without needing to navigate away from the page. The formats supported on dashboards — charts, metric blocks, and tables — are the same as those available in Insights.



![Bug Performance Dashboard](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/bd1540bfabec98d610d36770d521b116d8538299-2246x2266.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

![Bug Performance Dashboard](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/bd1540bfabec98d610d36770d521b116d8538299-2246x2266.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Filtering dashboards⁠

Dashboards support flexible filtering to help you tailor what data is shown:



- Dashboard-level filters: When you create or edit a dashboard, you can set filters that apply globally to all insights in that dashboard. For example, if you filter for issues created by the “Design” team, every insight on that dashboard will reflect that filter automatically. You can configure multiple filters, and once the dashboard is saved, you can optionally hide these dashboard-level filters from view using the “saved filters” button to reduce visual clutter; this does not affect whether they apply.
- Insight-level filters: In addition to dashboard-level filters, individual insights on a dashboard can have their own filters. These filters apply only to that specific insight and can further refine the data it shows. For example, one insight might add a filter for a particular label or project while another shows all issues.
- Filters when adding existing insights: If you add an existing insight (e.g., from a View) to a dashboard, that insight will automatically inherit the dashboard-level filters. This means the insight may look different when viewed inside the dashboard than when viewed in its original View, since it will reflect both its own filters and any global filters set at the dashboard level.

![Adding an insight from an existing custom view to a dashboard](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/644a864b6ba70c142ae19d2a1713daf78092582a-2258x1512.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Managing dashboards⁠

Each dashboard has an owner, which is typically the person who created it. Ownership can be changed at any time from the context menu beside the dashboard name.

You can also move a dashboard to another team, the workspace, or your personal dashboards using the “Move to…” option in its context menu. When a dashboard is moved to Personal, it will appear in the Dashboards tab on the workspace-level Views page, under a separate “Personal dashboards” heading. These dashboards remain visible only to you.

To ensure you’re viewing the most recent data within a dashboard, use the Refresh data option in the context menu.

### Private teams⁠

Dashboards have limited support for private teams. By default, workspace-level dashboards do not include data from private teams. To include insights from a private team, a dashboard must either be created inside that team or moved to your personal dashboards.

## Overview⁠

Insights turns your Linear issues into a dataset you can analyze to better understand how you work. Use Insights to answer questions like:

- What projects take up the most resources?
- How quickly do you fix bugs?
- How consistently do you prioritize issues?
- Do you estimate accurately?

## Configure⁠

Most issue views in Linear have an Insights panel in the righthand sidebar, which you can open with Cmd/Ctrl Shift I. Find Insights in Custom Views as well as team, project, and cycle views.

The best place to use Insights is in custom Views that are shared at the Workspace level. They offer the most flexibility and power, since you can access issue data from all teams and filter across any property (e.g. Label, Assignee, Project) in your workspace.

### Examples⁠

The best way to learn how Insights works is to try it. We’ve built an in-app Help Center that walks you through common use cases. You can view instructions on how to create these examples or select a button to apply the example to your current view.

Access the Help Center by selecting the … icon from the Insights panel and selecting Insights examples

## Create Insights⁠

### Apply filters⁠

Insights will offer analytics for all the issues in the view you’re currently looking at. Add or remove filters to change which issues are included in the dataset. The following filters can be especially helpful when creating Insights.

To include Archived issues in your Insights analysis, open the Insights options (to the left of the three dot menu, just above the Segment dropdown) and toggle on Show archived issues. From there you can also filter out issues without a priority assignment.

### Select Insights Parameters⁠

From the dropdown, choose the Measure and Slice for your Insight. This will generate a graph and table showing the data, with the Measure along the y-axis and Slice along the x-axis. Segments are optional and use color to slice the data further.

Values for Measure, Slice, and Segment vary depending on what issues are displayed in your view.

### Graph Interactions⁠

Insight graphs are interactive, so that you can play with the dataset to learn more or focus on a specific type of issue.

#### Bar graph⁠

- Hover over each bar to see data and percentile breakdowns.
- Select full bars or segments to temporarily filter your view to only those issues.
- Hovering or selecting bars or segments will highlight related data in the table below the graph.

#### Scatterplot⁠

- Hover over the graph to see markers indicating that the data below the line represents 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of issues plotted.
- Select percentile markers to zoom in or out along the y-axis.
- Hover over points to see the issue details including the issue name, ID, and slice and segment values. This will also highlight related data in the table below the graph.
- Select points to go to open the related issue.

#### Burn-up charts⁠

- Burn-up charts, or cumulative flow diagrams show how streams of work have changed over time. Unlike other insights, burn-up charts display your historical issue data so you can analyze and detect patterns across specific time windows.
- By default, burn-up charts show data in monthly increments. Adjust insights settings to plot the data week over week, or to include archived issues.
- When applicable, select Burn-up under the Slice menu to visualize your data in this style.

#### Table (below graph)⁠

- Hover over row or specific cell to see corresponding data in graph
- Select row, column, or cell to temporarily filter issue view to only those issues

### Share Insights⁠

Select the three dot menu on the top right of the Insights panel to share your Insight.

- Copy a link, which can be viewed by anyone else in your workspace
- Export to CSV, to explore the data outside of Linear

### Full Screen view⁠

Insights can be opened in Full Screen view by selecting the expand button (just above the Segment dropdown). This gives you more room to explore the graph and table data.
