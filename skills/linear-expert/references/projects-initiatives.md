# Projects

Create Projects for features or large units of work.

![Project overview in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/5622bb57d625b2dbbe27639fe6f685e1c43589bd-2105x1332.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Projects are units of work that have a clear outcome or planned completion date, such as a new feature's launch and are comprised of issues and optional documents. They can be shared across multiple teams and come with their own unique features, progress graph, and notification options.

## Create a project⁠

Create new projects directly from your workspace or team's project view by clicking the + button. This action opens a prompt where you're asked to fill in specific fields. While the only required field is the project name, we recommend also assigning a project lead and updating the project icon for better visibility and organization. To edit these properties later, simply right-click on a project within an Initiative or custom project view and select Edit project, or click on these properties from the project overview page.

## Delete a project⁠

To delete a project that you have in focus, click the three dots next to the project name beside the Overview and Issues tabs and select Delete.

From a view containing multiple projects, you can also right click on any project and select Delete from the bottom of the menu.

Once you've confirmed this action, your deleted projects can be found in the team's archive under the "Recently deleted projects" tab for 30 days before they are permanently deleted.

## View your projects⁠

Each team has a Projects page which organizes the team's projects into a list, board, or timeline. There is also a Projects page at the workspace level so you can view all projects within your workspace in one location.

To explore a specific project, click on it to access the project overview. Here, you'll find a brief project summary, project properties, any associated documents and links, a detailed project description, and a list of project milestones.

## Add issues to a project⁠

Add existing issues to projects or move issues between projects by selecting the issues and using the shortcut Shift P. To create new issues in a project, use C from the project view or add the project property manually if creating the issue from another page.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/fe28ec4f7bbfbb43fa8aa5431c4cbef8158cc0d3-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

How we work: The project lead is in charge of writing the spec and general execution. Other team members collaborate on the brief, split up areas of work, and then write their own issues.

Issues can only be associated with one project at a time. A workaround would be to create sub-issues for the task, then assign each sub-issue to a different project.

## Attach issue views to projects⁠

Next to the "Issues" tab in each project, you'll find the new view icon. This feature enables the creation of custom views of the project's issues. By clicking this icon, you can filter a subset of the issues and save this filtered perspective under a specific view name.

Once a view is created within the project, it can be repositioned by clicking and dragging it to the left or right to adjust the order in which these views appear. These views are accessible to anyone who has access to the project and are displayed as tabs, similar to the Overview and Issues tabs, allowing users to easily share and switch between different perspectives within the project.

Additionally, right-clicking on a view opens options to copy the view link, add it to your favorites, edit its details, or delete it.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/651ff9aec032ed0b1bad30ccb269b5c7a5c332f0-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Example views we've attached to projects: A view we use often is a view that filters for all issues assigned to the current user. This ensures everyone viewing a project can quickly view all their issues. We also use a bug view that filters for all issues with the "bug" label. A "standup" view filtering for In Progress helps us have more efficient standups.

## Attach project views to workspace projects page ⁠

Similar to attaching issue views to projects, you can also attach project views within the workspace projects page. This allows you to create custom views of projects in your workspace. These views can be repositioned just like attached issue views within projects and are accessible to all members of your workspace.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/fe28ec4f7bbfbb43fa8aa5431c4cbef8158cc0d3-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Example project views we've attached: In our workspace, we have attached a project view that filters for all projects with an “In Progress” status. Projects are automatically added to this view based on the selected filters, eliminating the need for manual curation. This makes it easy to reference and see all in-progress projects at a glance. We also have an attached project view that filters for all projects involving a specific team, allowing us to quickly review that team’s activity.



## Project details sidebar⁠

Press the sidebar icon or use Cmd/Ctrl I to toggle the project details sidebar on or off. You'll be able to update any properties from here as well as add resources such as external files, create project documents, and view the project progress graph.

## Multi-team projects⁠

Projects can be shared across multiple teams. Add more teams when creating a project or from the project details page by clicking on the team name, then marking off more teams in the dropdown. Once you add more than one team, the project view will create tabs so you can toggle between seeing all issues or issues on specific teams.

![Adding team to a project in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/1561a37e65dab956fcd7db8c2bf44c748e67608b-1260x804.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Timeframes⁠

Rarely will a project's precise end date be known in its early stages. Select start and target dates that match your level of certainty. Options are available to choose a year, half-year, quarter, month or precise day. Choose start and target dates using these timeframes by selecting the appropriate fields in the project's right sidebar.

You can also use these timeframes in project views in Initiatives when grouping by start or target date, or in start/target date filters as well as created at under the "custom date or timeframe…" option.

## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/projects#collapsible-f088bd16d8ba)Technically yes, you can create a project without a completion date -- but we encourage projects to have a clear start and end. We're looking into better ways to manage this type of work but in the meantime there are a few workarounds:

- Use projects without target dates (you may want to create an Initiative to group these projects)
- Break up the work into smaller time-based projects (e.g. bugweek, Q1 infrastructure)
- In cases where a project should remain unclosed for some time but not forever, consider creating a custom Maintenance project status.

[](https://linear.app/docs/projects#collapsible-d8fe4f59d04d)We have a single lead field to keep ownership of the project clear. If more people are involved with the project, consider adding them as members, however members have to opt-in to receive notifications.

[](https://linear.app/docs/projects#collapsible-848f54643743)It will default to show you the following options when adding a project to an issue: Projects you lead, are a member of, created by user recently, has overlapping teams with user, active, recently created, then cancelled and completed.

[](https://linear.app/docs/projects#collapsible-846e2805cb0c)Roadmaps are renamed to Initiatives and can be enabled in your workspace settings. Timeline views are available on any view with projects in your team projects view, inside an initiative or the workspace projects view. You can choose a timeline view under "Display".

# Project milestones

Project milestones help you divide and organize work inside projects.

![Multiple project milestones visible on a timeline](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/59f96a11448bfb1bc23d25979f45975cfe8a8f28-1046x545.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview ⁠

Project milestones represent different stages in a project’s lifecycle. You can easily create milestones, add issues to milestones, and track the progress of each milestone in a project. Progress towards project milestones are also visible from Initiatives and project views on a timeline to help quickly contextualize the current state of work.



Shift M to add a milestone to an issue or to move an issue to another milestone

milestone to add a milestone to an issue or to move an issue to a different milestone

- Click on the  icon beside the milestones header in the project details pane to create a new milestone
- Click on the calendar icon when creating a milestone to add a date
- Click on the … icon beside an existing milestone to edit or delete the milestone
- Click on the date beside an existing milestone to edit the date

## Basics⁠

### Create milestones⁠

When viewing the project overview, you can easily create milestones directly beneath the detailed project description. Here, you have the option to add descriptions to each milestone and monitor their progress.

Alternatively, whether in the project overview or while browsing issues within a project, you can open the project details pane (⌘ I) and create a new milestone by clicking  beside the milestones header. Milestones can also be created through the command menu (⌘ / ctrl+K.)

While assigning a date to a milestone is optional, you can add one at any time after the milestone has been created. Additionally, on the project timeline, right-clicking on a selected date allows you to add a milestone directly to that date.



### Edit and delete milestones⁠

When viewing existing milestones in the project overview, hover over each milestone to access additional options by clicking the ⋮ Here, you can delete the milestone or copy its link. You also have the opportunity to set or edit the milestone’s target date in this view.

In the project information pane, click the … icon beside each milestone to edit or delete the milestone. next to each milestone to either edit or delete it. If you need to assign or change a milestone’s target date, click "Edit" and then select the date using the calendar icon.

On a project timeline view, you can right-click on a milestone to delete or when selected hit ⌘/ctrlbackspace.

You can also drag milestones on the timeline to your preferred date, select multiple or hold shift to drag all to a new date.



### Add milestones to issues⁠

If an issue belongs to a project that contains milestones, you can add a milestone to the issue from the command menu by searching "Add to milestone". You can also use the keyboard shortcut Shift M, or you can drag the issue onto the milestone in the project details pane.When creating a new issue in a project with milestones, we will automatically suggest suitable milestones during the creation process. You can choose one of the suggestions or click on the diamond icon to choose another milestone.



### Filter and group by milestones⁠

Filter by milestone by pressing F from within a project, searching for the Milestone filter type and choosing the desired milestones. Alternatively, open the project details pane and quickly filter for a single milestone by clicking on it.When viewing an issue that has a milestone attached, you can also click on the arrow beside the milestone in the issue details pane to open the project with that milestone applied as a quick filter.Clicking into the display options for a project permits grouping by milestone.



### Reorder milestones⁠

When viewing milestones in the project overview, you can rearrange the order by hovering over each milestone and dragging the ⋮⋮ icon to change the order of the milestone. The same process applies in the project details pane. Simply hover over a milestone and use the ⋮⋮ icon to drag and reorder it as desired.



### Convert milestones to projects⁠

You may find that a milestone grows large enough to handle as its own project. When this happens, convert the milestone to a project through the overflow menu on an individual milestone. When you take this action, we'll suggest properties like project description and priority based on the content of the original milestone and the properties of the original project.



## Milestones and Initiatives⁠

When viewing projects within an Initiative, the current milestone is displayed on the timeline alongside its completion percentage. The same is true when viewing projects within a team. Hover or click a milestone to view more details.Double-clicking on a milestone from either view will open the project with that milestone applied as a quick filter. Clear this filter from the project details sidebar to view all issues within the project.

You can also filter by completed and upcoming milestones on the initiative view. Click  Filter at the top of an initiative, choose between Next milestone and Completed milestones, and then enter the text contained with the milestone names you are looking for.



## Milestones progress⁠

When viewing milestones in the project details pane, we will show a completion percentage for each milestone. This is the percentage of issues in the milestone that have been moved to a completed status.The diamond icon for the milestone will change depending on the completion status and the milestone currently being worked towards will have a yellow icon to show focus. Take a look at the below video to see this in action.

If you have access to our Insights feature, you will be able to view milestones as a dimension and segment milestones by status type so you can see which milestones are currently in progress.

## How Linear uses milestones⁠

Once we had completed a functional prototype, we used milestones to help us organize work inside our milestones project. We chose the following milestones:

- Internal alpha
- Beta 1
- Beta 2
- Public launch
- Post launch

In our weekly project syncs, we were able to quickly see at a glance the current milestone's completion percentage. We could also easily filter for issues in the current milestone to check if there were any issues we needed to discuss or move to another milestone.Looking at how other teams have used milestones while in beta, we have seen similar patterns of dividing work into development and release phases.



## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/project-milestones#collapsible-45f9b81f6ab1)It's not possible to remove the yellow icon beside the next incomplete milestone in a project. In the majority of cases, this icon appearing yellow signals a current focus on this milestone but if you are running multiple milestones in parallel, you can ignore this indicator.

[](https://linear.app/docs/project-milestones#collapsible-e1fc7fb1cce8)This isn't currently possible. You will need to recreate milestones in each individual project on your workspace.

# Initiatives

Use initiatives to group projects by company objective to align on your organization's goals and track progress towards achieving them.

![Initiatives on a Linear workspace called RideShare](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/6da64501f5bd32cedef0dbf9b1faf9b09f676e58-3024x1730.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

An Initiative is a manually curated list of projects with an accompanying document. All Initiatives are shown within a single Initiatives view at the workspace level. Their purpose is to express the goals and objectives an organization aims to achieve and to monitor progress towards those aims. This enables high-level planning across multiple projects and long timelines.

Leadership can use the top-level Initiatives view to see a quick overview of ongoing goals, objectives, and their progress. This allows them to assess overall progress without needing to drill down into each individual project.

## Basics⁠

### Create and view initiatives⁠

Navigate to the Initiatives page in your sidebar to create and view existing Initiatives. This page contains all active Initiatives in your workspace. Each Initiative name appears with a short summary, Initiative owner, associated teams, number of projects within, target date, and health status. You can also create a new Initiative from here.

To create an Initiative, all you need is a name. Initiatives will be visible by all members of your workspace except for guests.

There is no concept of a “private” Initiative—Initiatives are always shared workspace-wide. If a project belonging to a private team is added to an initiative, the project remains visible only to those in the private team but the Initiative is viewable by others.

### Initiative Health and Active Projects⁠

When viewing Initiatives, use the Initiative Health and Active projects columns to quickly assess how work is progressing.

![Initiative health and active projects displayed](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/bd52bb969d596bccc676f6f49c388ea80beb55ce-954x480.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Initiative Health shows whether the latest initiative update indicated work was on track, at risk, or off track. Click on it to read the full update.

Active Projects rolls up data for individual projects in the initiative based on each project's latest project update. These are color coded, and clicking on them shows the associated updates:

- Green: On track
- Yellow: At risk
- Red: Off track
- Gray: No recent update

For projects marked as at risk or off track, consider commenting and to check in and offer assistance. For projects without a recent update, you can mention the project lead to check for any missed updates or potential blockers. Read more about Project and Initiative Updates here.

### Lifecycle management⁠

Designating Initiatives as planned, active or complete clearly signals the Initiative's current state. When an Initiative is completed, it will move to the completed section to maintain a historical record of work. To change the status of an Initiative, click on the Initiative and update its status from the Initiatives overview page.

### Initiatives overview page⁠

Use the Overview page to share detailed information about the overall Initiative and the projects within it. From this page, you can access and modify the following Initiative properties:

- Status: Indicates if an Initiative is Planned, Active, or Completed.
- Owner: Initially set to the creator of the Initiative but can be reassigned to another workspace member.
- Target Date: The expected completion date of the Initiative.
- Resources: Relevant documents or links associated with the Initiative.
- Latest update: The most recent Initiative update.
- Descriptions: Detailed information about the Initiative.
- Project List: Each project included in the Initiative.

### Initiative graph⁠

Each curve on an initiative graph represents the rate of completed issues within a single project in that initiative -- rising during periods of high activity and leveling off during quieter periods or after project completion. Hover over the x-axis to see your most active projects in a given week, or focus one at a time.

![Graph of projects in an initiative, with toolchain refresh in focus](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/3c264b6668a09f156fce371c8afc4b92a9ce0b58-1520x680.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Sub-initiatives ⁠

Use sub-initiatives to organize your company goals, workstreams, or OKRs into a structured hierarchy. This feature allows Initiatives to be nested inside one another, enabling deeper planning and visibility across large programs of work.

Available to workspaces on our Enterprise plan.

![Sub-initiatives](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/751d06e6c76d6b75b21fcd71da3cf91770d27a8b-2368x1780.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### How sub-initiatives work⁠

Sub-initiatives let you nest Initiatives up to five levels deep in a tree-like structure. A parent Initiative automatically includes all the projects it owns directly, as well as all the projects from its sub-initiatives. This makes it easy to roll up work from multiple departments, teams, or quarters into one overarching goal.

You can use sub-initiatives to:

- Structure company-wide objectives across multiple departments
- Break down a large strategic goal into phased delivery Initiatives
- Group Initiatives by quarter, theme, or ownership

Each Initiative can only have one parent. Projects added to any sub-initiative will automatically be included in the parent’s view of progress.

### Creating and managing sub-initiatives⁠

You can create and organize sub-initiatives from two places in Linear:

From the workspace Initiative views (Active, Planned, Completed)

- Create a new Initiative using the  New Initiative button or the keyboard shortcut N then I. You can also choose a parent Initiative during creation.
- Nest Initiatives by holding Option (Alt on Windows) while dragging one beneath another.
- To remove a parent, drag the Initiative out of the nested section and drop it elsewhere in the list to return it to the top level.
- These pages are best for managing structure across multiple teams or quarters.

From an Initiative Overview page

- Use the  Add button in the top right, or the ... menu beside the Initiative title, to create or attach sub-initiatives.
- Use the  icon above the sub-initiative list (if shown) to add more.
- Use the command menu (Cmd + K) or shortcut Cmd + Shift + P to set or change the parent.

Sub-initiatives created from an Overview page are nested under that Initiative automatically.

### Viewing sub-initiatives⁠

Sub-initiatives appear nested beneath their parent Initiative both on the full workspace Initiative views (Active, Planned, or Completed) and on the parent’s Initiative Overview page. If you’d like to temporarily collapse or expand a nested list, press T — this affects only your own view.

By default, a parent Initiative’s project list includes all projects from its sub-initiatives. You can adjust this using the display settings in the top right of the project list to show only directly owned projects. Each sub-initiative displays a project count, which includes all projects from any further sub-initiatives nested within it.



When Initiatives are grouped by owner or other properties, parent Initiatives will still appear above their sub-initiatives to provide context — but they’ll be shown grayed out if they don’t directly match the grouping property.

### Visibility and filtering⁠

Sub-initiatives follow the same visibility rules as standard Initiatives: they’re visible to all workspace members except guests. If a project belongs to a private team, its details remain restricted — but the Initiative itself will still be listed.

When viewing a parent Initiative, filters (such as by team, status, or project health) will include projects from all of its sub-initiatives. This gives you a complete picture of progress at every level of the hierarchy.

## Example use cases⁠

- Engineering managers might look at a pipeline view to help them manage immediately upcoming staffing needs
- Product leaders may want to use and revise a scenario plan across multiple quarters
- Marketing leaders might look at a release timeline filtered only on projects that require serious GTM communication
- Product leaders may want to see an overview of all larger asks from customers that are currently being prioritized and actively worked on

## Initiatives vs. Project Views⁠

Initiatives are manually curated lists of projects that typically align with organizational goals, allowing leadership to easily track progress towards these goals.

If you want to group and filter projects automatically — but they don’t align with clear organizational goals or need close progress tracking — we recommend using project views instead. You can also use project labels to help further categorize and organize projects.

The advantage of project views is that once you set up relevant project filters, all future projects matching these criteria will be automatically included. These views are also visible to all members of your workspace.

For example, you can create a project view to filter all projects with an “In Progress” status, allowing you to see all such projects across your workspace in one place. Another example is creating a view that filters all projects involving your team members, providing a consolidated view of team activities.

# Initiative and Project updates

Keep teams and leaders aligned with structured updates on the health and progress of Initiatives and Projects, available in Linear and Slack.

![Initiative updates view in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/f66eac289e2ba135172cf414b51fcc5ba5c2db2f-3312x1732.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Initiative and Project updates are structured reports that keep teams and leaders informed on progress and alignment. They consist of a health indicator that provides high-level signal of the current state and a rich text description for deeper insights into status, challenges, and next steps.

Initiative updates help leaders and teams stay aligned on high-level goals while still providing visibility into the projects that contribute to them. Project updates focus on individual projects, ensuring teams stay informed on progress at a more granular level. Updates can be viewed in Linear and sent to Slack channels.

![Project update health indicators](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/3a1609dc34b766530571d44ac4a2da30f825ae4d-3598x2700.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Configure Initiative updates⁠

Initiative updates can be configured by admins in Workspace Settings. Once Initiatives are turned on, Admins can set up reminders to ensure Initiative owners post updates consistently. These settings allow you to choose how often reminders are sent, such as weekly or biweekly, and specify the day and time when reminders will appear. Reminders are only sent when there is an Initiative owner.

Admins can also configure a default Slack channel where all Initiative updates are sent. Creating a dedicated channel, such as #initiative-updates, helps ensure updates are visible and accessible to the entire team.

## Configure Project updates⁠

Configure project updates for your workspace under workspace settings. Select a Slack channel where updates will go (we recommend a dedicated one such as #project-updates) and set optional reminders to remind project leads to post an update at a regular cadence (e.g. post an update weekly on Wednesdays).

Configure notifications for specific projects by clicking the bell icon in the project's header. From there, you can link the project to its own Slack channel (e.g. #p-project-name) to send updates and notifications there.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/95a933639d33ab31c5ac1c56744755344279f769-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

A project must be associated with at least 1 public team for its updates to appear in the channel chosen from the workspace-level project settings. For private-team only projects, you will need to configure separate notifications.

## Basics⁠

### Create Initiative and Project updates⁠

Updates can be created from the Project Overview or Initiative Overview page. The owner or lead is responsible for posting the first update, after which any workspace member can write subsequent updates.

To draft or edit an update, click the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the latest update in the Initiative or Project overview page. When writing an update, you can highlight text to apply formatting and upload files to provide supporting context.

Select a health indicator—On track, At risk, or Off track—to represent the current state of the Initiative or Project.

![Health status for Initiative and Project Updates in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/ed5ece3832c555a0d48ef2a70212008ca49a55de-1774x462.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### View Initiative and Project updates⁠

The most recent update is displayed on the Project Overview or Initiative Overview page. To view previous updates, click on the Updates tab.

When viewing a list of Initiatives, you can also click on the health status to see the most recent updates.

Updates appear in chronological order, and anyone can react with emoji to express sentiment. You can also view updates in Slack if they have been configured to post there.

To share an update, you can copy a link or copy it as Markdown using the ⌘/Ctrl  K action menu.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/fe28ec4f7bbfbb43fa8aa5431c4cbef8158cc0d3-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

How we work: The project lead adds weekly project updates. As well as viewing these in Linear, we have these set up to appear in a specific channel in our Slack workspace. We can then easily discuss each update in a Slack thread originating from the original posted message. During weekly syncs, we'll review project updates directly in Linear. We take a few minutes to silently read them and emoji react depending on how we'd like to discuss them in the meeting. ✋ means you have a question, ▶️ means you want to see a demo, and we usually see a few others like 🚀🙌 🥳.

### Updates tab⁠

Visit the updates tab to see the history of all updates and changes to a project or initiative.

Updates appear in chronological order along with any changes to properties such as the target date, members, and milestones. On initiatives, you can enable a display option to also see updates from sub-initiatives and projects, so all relevant information appears in one place.

### Progress reports for Initiatives and Projects⁠

Project updates include a concise overview of project progress since the last update. It covers information such as project delays, changes in the target date, assignment of new leads, progress towards milestones, and overall progress. These updates help you track project changes and effectively communicate progress to stakeholders.

If progress appears when drafting a project update, you can choose to exclude it from posting by clicking Hide details. Overall project progress must have changed by more than 2% since the last update in order for progress details to appear here.

For Initiative updates, if the Initiative owner has changed since the previous update, or there has been a change in target date or status, this will automatically be included in the update.

### Manage notifications⁠

Updates can be sent to Slack, delivered to your Linear Inbox, or both, depending on your preferences. Notifications can be configured at both the workspace and individual update level to ensure teams stay informed in the way that works best for them.

Admins can configure a default Slack channel for all Initiative and Project updates in Workspace Settings or through the Slack integration settings. We recommend using dedicated channels such as #initiative-updates and #project-updates to keep updates organized.

For individual Initiatives and Projects, you can override the default Slack channel by clicking the bell icon in the respective view. This allows you to select a custom Slack channel for updates (e.g., #p-project-name), ensuring the right audience is kept in the loop.

If Slack notifications are enabled, edits to updates will also be reflected in Slack. Additionally, you can enable Inbox notifications in your account settings to receive updates directly in your Linear Inbox.

### Initiative and project update comments⁠

It’s possible to comment under Initiative and Project updates to discuss them further. The person who wrote the update and anyone who participates in the thread will receive notifications in their Linear Inbox.

If the Slack integration is enabled and updates are posted in a Slack channel, comments will be bi-directionally synced between Linear and Slack. This ensures that all messages in the Slack thread will sync back to the update in Linear, just as Slack comments on issues sync with Linear.

### Initiative and Project update reminders⁠

Admins can enable update reminders in Workspace Settings to ensure Initiative and Project updates are posted consistently. Once enabled, you can customize the frequency of reminders, choosing whether they are sent daily or at a set interval (e.g., weekly or biweekly). You can create custom schedules and also specify the day and time for reminders. Leads will receive reminders in the designated time window in their local timezone.

Reminders are sent for active Initiatives and Projects with statuses in the started category, and only to the Initiative owner or project lead. If an update isn’t made after the initial reminder, follow-up nudges will be sent 1 working day later, and 2 working days after this.

When selecting a reminder time, note that reminders may not be sent precisely at the chosen hour but will be delivered within the hour selected or shortly after.

### Project-level update schedule⁠

You can also change the update schedule for individual project from the bell icon on the project view menu. Toggle between the following options for your project:

- Follow the workspace default notification schedule
- Set a custom schedule for this project
- Never receive update reminders for this project

![custom schedule settings for project updates](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/b437ead6477d22c77b1def389a22d218274a02ad-1464x921.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Project staleness⁠

When project update reminders are enabled, in-progress projects that are overdue for updates will reflect this for easier monitoring. If an update schedule is configured for a project, its health icon will reflect when an update has been missed. Projects that remain overdue for an extended period will have their icon turn grey to indicate inactivity.

Projects are marked Update Missing when both of the following are true:

- The last project update was On Track
- An update is 2 reminder cycles + 3 days overdue past the expected update frequency

Projects will instead show No Update expected if they completed or their update schedule is set to Never.

A dashed outline indicates a update project update is slightly overdue before the health icon turns grey and the status changes

You can filter projects by " Date > latest project update" (e.g. “before 1 week ago”) for more control.

![Date and health filters on Project View](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/ffbec8348ab58cf0dd16f1e2568af9caa26aa4b6-1260x465.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

# Project documents

Create documents for projects.

![Image of a project spec document in Linear](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/b6f23daab4c4dd506639b9b6cdc8ae856246ed0d-1610x894.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Create documents inside of projects to keep relevant information and updates in one central place. Use documents to create specs, PRDS, and share status updates with the project team.

## Create documents⁠

Create documents when inside of a project by navigating to the project overview and adding a document under the Resources section. You'll be required to give the document a title and can pick a custom icon and icon color. Projects use the same Markdown editor as issues. In documents, you can type in plain text, use code snippets, format with headers and reference issues and projects. You can also create documents in issues themselves.

## Create document templates⁠

You can create document templates to write documents faster and guide creators to share information effectively. These templates can be selected when creating a new document inside a project or issue.To create a document template, you can navigate to either the workspace template settings or team template settings. Once you've created the document template, press save to make the template available for your team and workspace members.To edit, duplicate or delete a template, go to the same page where you created the templates and then hover over the template name in order to show contextual controls. Click on the overflow menu and take the desired action.

## Document subscriptions⁠

You can subscribe to notifications for specific documents by clicking on the bell icon in the upper right of the document and selecting yourself or another team member to notification.

This will also subscribe you to notifications in the description section of a project overview.

The creator of a document will be automatically subscribed to the changes in the document.

![Subscribe members to document](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c7378992d628c0b31a809268c31dfcd0b5b66da6-734x156.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Notification types include document changes, comments, and replies. You do not get a notifications for actions you have taken on a document, but you will receive notifications for when

- A comment or reply has been made in a document.
- Material changes to the content of a document.
- A document was deleted.
- A team member subscribes or unsubscribes you to a document.
- A team member mentions you in a document

## Collaborative editing⁠

Edit documents by opening them and clicking anywhere in the editor to begin editing. We'll show when the document was last edited and by whom. Linear offers collaborative editing, so you'll see input cursors if another user is editing or viewing the text. All changes are instantly saved and synced to everyone in realtime. You can revert documents to a previous version in the … menu at the top and choosing "Revert document content".

## Editor slash commands⁠

Type / to see additional formatting options in documents (and issues.) Using this menu you can create formatting types including:

- Headers (H1, H2, H3)
- Lists (bulleted, numbered, checklists)
- Codeblocks
- Dividers
- Blockquotes

## Open documents⁠

While in a project view, you can open documents with the shortcut O then D or by selecting the relevant document from the Overview tab on a specific project.

## Reference documents⁠

Reference documents in issue descriptions, comments, and even in other documents by typing @ while in edit mode followed by the document name. This action can also be used to reference issues or projects; matching documents will appear in the lowest section.

## Link to headers⁠

To copy a URL to a specific header, hover over the left side and click Copy heading URL. Sharing this URL with a colleague in your workspace will direct them to this specific section.

![Copy heading URL button on the left side of header formatted text](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/901c6d1a7644e409c7f958bf76df67135a4533bb-329x153.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### External URLs⁠

If you'd like to link related files that live outside of Linear, you can add a link to the Resources section of a Project overview.

# Project graph

The graph shows you the progress you're making toward completing your project and estimates when you'll complete it.

![Project graph visual showing progress](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/b9e538ee1cb80570e8b6ba5d7267140c3a1ae2db-958x912.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Project graphs autogenerate once the status of a project has been moved to a Started status and we've collected enough project issue data for them to be created. Project graph statistics update hourly with the latest issue activity, and the time granularity of graph points is every 7 days. Predictions are calculated based on weekly velocity data.

## Where to find it⁠

From the project view, open the project sidebar Cmd/Ctrl I to view the graph. If it's not there, that means that we have not generated it yet.

![image](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c377a88c314fd6d0ceacf255f927c3220f1d9a07-16x16.svg?q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

ProTip: It can be helpful to set a target date to deter scope creep and create accountability for the project to ship in a reasonable amount of time.

## How to read it⁠

A gray line shows you the project scope and how it has changed over time, giving you an easy way to see (and mitigate) scope creep.We have separate lines for Started and Completed issues. This lets you see exactly what is being worked on and what is done. Blue bars also indicate completed issues over time for ease of interpretation when Started and Completed lines overlap.You can see how a project’s issues break down by assignee and label, as well as what percentage of issues in those categories have been completed. You can hover over any assignee or label and click "filter" to show related issues.You can also hover over the graph to see the exact values of scoped, completed and started issues over time.

If you have a target date set, it'll show up as a red vertical line.

### Live predictions⁠

We show an estimated completion date for the project as long as you've moved an issue into a "Started" status. You'll see the purple line for completed issues continues on with a dotted line to the predicted completion date. The graph will always start at 0.

The projected completion date(s) are calculated by how long it will take to complete the remaining issues based on the current weekly project velocity.

Project velocity is calculated based on weekly historical data: how many completed issue points per week. More recent weeks are weighted more heavily, as they indicate a more current rate of progress. We need at least one week of data to show prediction.

Remaining issue points are calculated by summing the points of incomplete issues with a 1/4 modifier for any in-progress issues. After calculating a predicted completion date, we offer an optimistic and pessimistic completion date that includes a buffer of about ±40%. When available, these predictions are displayed as dotted lines starting from the Completed line at the current date.



## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/project-graph#collapsible-5e1839c99ed8)This can happen when project scope is reduced, in order to maintain a representative relationship between the Scope and Progress lines. Examples include when someone deletes or removes issues from a project, cancels issues from a project, or reduces issue scope.

[](https://linear.app/docs/project-graph#collapsible-7d8798c5a602)If estimates are off in a team, all issues are treated as 1 estimate point for the purposes of building the project graph.

# Project status

Project statuses clarify where each project is in its lifecycle

![Project status](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/d0cd238fd35bbe86e9d30f274cf9e5ccaafc3832-1168x1268.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

A project status offers a quick update for stakeholders to gauge the progress of the status. The status will appear next to the project name in the initiative or project timeline pages as well as in an icon on the project bar.

## Change a project's status⁠

Project statuses are updated manually—we do not do this automatically, even if all issues are completed.

## Create a custom project status⁠

Project statuses can have customized name, description, and color, which is configured in Settings -> Projects -> Statuses.  You can have multiple statuses within the available project status categories: Backlog, Planned, In Progress, Completed, and Canceled.

## Archive projects⁠

Projects are archived based on the team's auto-archive setting as long as all issues within the project are closed, and the project is also marked as closed.

We archive issues the same time as their project—even if they have been closed for longer than the auto-archive setting—in order to not affect project statistics. Therefore, closed issues do not archive unless the project is closed.

Archived projects are accessible in a team's archive page.

## Delete projects⁠

Deleting a project will move it to the recently deleted projects section of your team's archive. A deleted project can be restored within 14 days after deleting, after which point it is no longer recoverable. To delete a project, open the three dot menu from the project's page and select Delete, or open command bar and select Delete project.

# Project labels

Organize projects with custom labels relevant to your organization's specific context. Filter projects or issues by their project's label to clearly segment work.

![Project label picker in a group](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/bd6d5d4dc03f49d56d4592399c8bf278de0797e1-1402x1178.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Project labels categorize work at scale and make it easier to filter, group, and locate projects across your workspace. While Initiatives are a great way to group projects by overarching company goal, project labels provide a more flexible and granular grouping dimension.

Use project labels to define project views grouped by label and filter issues themselves by their upstream project's label to get a granular understanding of work contributing towards a common area.

### Create a project label or group⁠

Project labels and groups can be created and managed in Settings > Projects > Labels. Alternatively, create a project label directly from the label menu on a project.

As with issue label groups, project label groups are mutually exclusive; only one sub-label per group may be applied to a project.

### Filtering and grouping⁠

Filtering projects by their label or label group allows you to organize work in units that make sense for your business and the way your work gets done.

Group projects by label or label group in project views, or issues by their project's label in issue views.

![Projects filtered and grouped by sub-label in a group](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/090809ea74d75ead6a530ca8d524151be584d917-2176x978.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### List project label columns⁠

When displaying a project view in a list format, you can add label groups as a display property by clicking on the Display menu and selecting the desired group. This will add a new column for that group at the list level.

![a label group column on a project list](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/e2c85e9aa8e8963cc7eb9e6a95c6ef1e919e7287-2366x932.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Insights⁠

Project label is a supported property on Insights, so you can now measure issue count, issue age, or triage time on issues in aggregate sliced by the project label upstream of those issues. Please note that when using this feature you'll be running Insights on issue views rather than project views, and slicing by the project's label the issues belong to.

Use this functionality to identify which upstream projects are driving the most work across your teams and compare performance metrics between project labels.

![Insights on issues by project label](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c55672fde5567ec5737efb93fa588a2ab684d9d1-1604x1413.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

# Project priority

Set project priority to indicate which projects to complete first.

![Linear app showing the priority menu on an issue](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/a071996f1c0bd3c3ac31f0599bd04f94d4af43d7-984x613.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Priority is an optional property for Linear projects to signify to your team the urgency of the project. You can add the following priorities to projects: no priority, low, medium, high, and urgent.

## Set priority⁠

Select a project (or multiple) from the projects view, type P then P to select the project priority. Use the shortcut again to change or remove the priority.You can also right-click on a project to set priority from the menu.

## Priority ordering⁠

By default, items without an assigned priority level are now always sorted last.

If projects are ordered by priority, you can manually or micro-adjust a projects position within the same priority group, if needed. So if you have multiple high priority projects for example, you can click and drag to reorder a project to be higher in its group. Dragging a project into a priority group will apply that same priority to the project.

# Project dependencies

Visualize blocked and blocking relationships amongst projects.

![stylized image of lines connecting projects with dependencies](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/1e5e2fc2de4cd906689e5bf0751223bc70010e99-3312x1734.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Project dependencies provide a visual depiction of blocking relationships on timeline views. Currently we only support a end -> start dependency.

## Create a project dependency⁠

You can establish a project dependency from the project's contextual menu by clicking the three dots next to the project name, or using command bar Cmd/Ctrl K. Select or hover over Dependencies, select or hover over Blocked by... or Blocking..., then select the related project.

You can also create dependencies from the timeline view. Hover at the end of a project bar to see a circle. Click and drag from that circle to another projects to create a new dependency.

## Working with dependencies on the timeline⁠

- Click on any dependency line to jump to a project, or remove that dependency.
- When dragging a project with dependencies, there are several ergonomics to help you plan quickly:Any projects in the dependency chain that are backlog or planned will be "bumped" with the dragged project. Hold Cmd/Ctrl to keep the chain in place.Hold Shift to move all projects in the dependency together, regardless of status.

## View project dependencies⁠

When a dependency relationship has been established, the Project Overview and the Project Properties right side panel will display "Blocked by" and "Blocking" fields.

Project dependencies can be seen on the project timeline view. You will see lines connecting the blocked and blocking projects.

### Dependency line color⁠

- The blue line depicts a dependency that has not been violated.
- The red line is a dependency that has been violated.

![blocked and blocking projects visualized in a timeline with lines connecting them](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/09ba034e341bdc7d30000031f69b7d4760f58f01-1752x482.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Dates used for dependency start/end⁠

- The dependency line will start at either the target end date or predicted end date (if no target end date is available) of the blocking project.
- The ferry line will link with either the target start date or the target end date of the blocked project.

## Filtering for project dependencies⁠

There are several filter options related to project dependencies:

- Project has dependencies
- Project has blocking dependency
- Project has blocked by dependency
- Project has violated dependencies

## Configure⁠

Open Settings > Templates to add a Workspace level project template, or the individual Team settings Templates page to add team-specific templates or edit existing ones.

## Basics⁠

### Create templates⁠

Create new templates by navigating to either the workspace template settings or team template settings. When creating a project template, you have the option to add the following:

- Project name
- Project description
- Team(s) the project lives in
- Project status
- Project lead
- Project members
- Associated initiatives
- Project milestones
- Issues to be created within the project

When you create a template for the workspace, all teams can use it. When you create a template for a team, only that team can use the template.



### Edit templates⁠

To edit or delete a template, go to the same page where you created the templates and then hover over the template name in order to show contextual controls. From there, you can edit the the template, rename it, duplicate it or delete it.

### Use templates⁠

When creating a new project, you will see the option to select a template beside the team identifier in the top left of the project create modal. You can also open our command menu using CMD K and search for the option to create a project using a template here.

## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/project-templates#collapsible-df6226879775)The template you are looking to use might be team-specific. Make sure you haven't opted to create the project in a team where the template does not live.



[](https://linear.app/docs/project-templates#collapsible-61785cdfae51)Yes, when an issue is added to the template the … menu will show the option to add a sub-issue. You can also add any issue template to the project template, including ones that have sub-issues in them.

# Cycles

Cycles are a practice to keep up your team's momentum, similar to commonly used agile flavored sprints.

![Image showcasing Cycle Details including percentage success, total effort, number of days ago and a chart showing effort and scope over time.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/d9c776ab4f3b38a56b22df4974c8719edc5557fb-1052x584.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Cycles are time-boxed periods where a team works on completing a pre-defined set of work. When enabled, Linear automatically creates upcoming cycles for your team. Unlike sprints, cycles are not tied to releases.

## Configure⁠

Configure cycles under Team Settings > Cycles. Turn on the toggle for Enable cycles. Required settings will show up in the cycle setting flow with defaults. You can always edit cycle configurations in the future.

![Cycle settings](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/2b6e55ce2413893807c7aef369f2a42a151deddd-1446x958.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Cycle duration⁠

In the Each cycle lasts field, select the number of weeks you want each cycle to last. Cycles can last anywhere from 1-8 weeks. It is not possible to create cycles with different durations or to start or end on specific dates. The goal of cycles having repeated intervals is to help you avoid the busywork associated with optimizing cycle timing and instead focus on shipping.

### Cooldowns after each cycle⁠

Including a cooldown period after each cycle to give your team a break and bandwidth to work through technical debt and other planning functions. Issues cannot be assigned to a cooldown.

### Starting day of the week⁠

Since cycles occur in regular intervals, you'll choose a specific day of the week for your cycles to start. Cycles begin at 12:01 AM on the chosen day based on the timezone configured in Team Settings > General.

### Upcoming cycles⁠

Select the number of future cycles to create so your team can assign issues to future cycles. The maximum number of futures that can be created is 15.

### Disable cycles⁠

When disabling the Cycles feature, the current cycle will be marked as completed and upcoming cycles will be removed. Any completed cycle data will be preserved for reference. You can choose to reenable cycles at any stage in the future.

## Adjust cycles⁠

### Move start and end dates⁠

In cases where a future cycle should deviate from the schedule, its start and end dates may be moved through the overflow menu on that cycle.

![Adjust cycle dates](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/a2fa4432d04b938961fb56cb83004878a0ecc904-1840x358.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Past cycle dates cannot be changed, but you can end your current cycle at the end of the current day if needed.

### Start a cycle today⁠

In some cases your team may wish to start a future cycle today instead of waiting for a future date. Take this action through the upcoming cycle's overflow menu.

- This action starts the upcoming cycle at 00:00 on the current day, per your team's timezone setting. Only the upcoming cycle can be started today.
- If the current cycle is active when we execute this action, we immediately complete it and roll issues over to the newly started cycle. If there is no currently active cycle, we act like cooldown has now ended for the previous cycle. If your current cycle also started today, you may not start the upcoming cycle today as well.

## Cycle automations⁠

### Issues rollover⁠

Cycles run on an automated schedule to reduce unnecessary date math and help create routine. Any unfinished work rolls over to the next cycle automatically. There is no way to keep unfinished issues in a closed cycle. If you forget to update an issue before the cycle ends, completed issues can still be moved over to the previous cycle.

### Auto-add active issues to current cycle⁠

![Cycle automations](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/225303175bf39059797fec985a1a0115553992de-1412x570.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

Auto-adding issues to a cycle helps to ensure all your work is captured by a cycle. You have the option to auto-add any Active, Started, or Completed issues that do not have a cycle assigned into the current cycle. If the current cycle is in cooldown, the issues will be added to the following cycle.

When toggling on Active issues option, an option will appear allowing you to

- Move existing active issues that are not assigned to a cycle to Move to Backlog (change it's status), or
- Keep in Active and put it into the current or next cycle (depending on cooldown settings).

An active status is a status in the "Unstarted" and "Started" category.

## Cycle calendars⁠

Keep up with your Linear cycles in your preferred calendar application by visiting your team's Cycles page, click on the overflow menu on a cycle, and hover over Subscribe to cycle calendar. Choose to add to Google Calendar, copy a feed URL, or download the calendar as an .ics file.

## Cycle capacity⁠

On the Cycles view, cycles that have not yet started will display a capacity dial that shows an estimate on whether your team will be likely to complete all the issues added to the cycle.Capacity is calculated from the velocity of the previous three completed cycles, i.e. the number of issues or estimate points completed in these cycles. If the team has not completed any cycles previously, capacity will be roughly estimated from the number of members in the team.

## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles#collapsible-9ff98f4bc540)We recommend creating a cycle starting today, and then setting further cycles to your regular cadence.

To do so, turn on Cycles in Settings > Team > Cycles. Choose today as your start date, which will create your current cycle. Then, edit the date field again to choose when your next cycle should start. This way, you'll create a cycle to reflect your work for the rest of the current cycle, but have your desired cycle cadence reflected moving forwards.

[](https://linear.app/docs/use-cycles#collapsible-98b1b1a12b26)Yes, sub-teams inherit the cycle schedule of their parent team. When you designate an existing team as a sub-team, its past cycles remain untouched but future cycles update to match the closest parent cycles.

# Update cycles

Update your cycles after they have been created

![Image showcasing Cycle Details including percentage success, total effort, number of days ago and a chart showing effort and scope over time.](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/d9c776ab4f3b38a56b22df4974c8719edc5557fb-1052x584.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

The Cycles view in the Team sidebar view provides a list of previous and future cycles (but not archived cycles). Most adjustments to a cycle can be made in this view.

Although cycles are automatically created, you are still able to adjust them as needed. Common use cases for adjusting are for holidays or when a team is out-of-office (e.g. company offsite.)

## Update cycle name and description⁠

From the Cycles view, click the three dots next to a Cycle and select Edit cycle... This allows you to update the name and description of the cycle to clarify your team's focus during that cycle. When updating a cycle name with a number at the end of the name, the following cycle will follow that number and begin a new numbering sequence from there.

## Change cycle dates⁠

Update a cycle's start or end date from the contextual menu on the Cycles page. This action is available for upcoming cycles and your current cycle.

It is not possible to change a cycle's date into the past.

![open menu on Cycles page showing Change cycle dates option](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/c4a0cdba030abed726adaa80cca76712f2f5cab6-1648x624.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

### Adjusting dates without cycle cooldowns⁠

When shortening the end date for a cycle, the time between the following cycle and the shortened cycle will display a "Cycles paused" period. When extending the end date for a cycle, the extended cycle will cut into the time for the following cycle—thus, shortening the following cycle.

### Adjusting dates with cycle cooldowns⁠

If Cooldown periods are turned on and cycle dates are adjusted, the Cooldown period will then say "Cycles paused" instead of "# week cooldown".

# Cycle graph

The graph displays the progress you've made in your cycle.

![Cycle graph visual showing progress](https://webassets.linear.app/images/ornj730p/production/ec0484ed17e913e650b6e875124052f3a286ffad-2110x976.png?w=1440&q=95&auto=format&dpr=2)

## Overview⁠

Cycle graphs autogenerate once a cycle has begun and update every hour. When viewing a specific cycle, open the cycle sidebar with Cmd/Ctrl I to view the graph.

From the Cycles view, you'll also see the graph belonging to the current cycle.

## How to read a cycle graph⁠

The gray line displays the total scope of your cycle.

The blue dotted line represents the "target"—an even distribution of the total estimated points within the cycle over the remaining days in the cycle. Note that it flattens over weekends due to the expectation people do not work during weekend. If your progress stays above that line, it is expected you will complete everything within the cycle.

The yellow line depicts the number of issues started.

The solid blue line shows how many issues have been completed.

The blue bars also represent completed issues. This can be useful to more easily compare relative issue completions over time, especially in cases when completed and started lines travel nearly identical paths.

## Understanding scope⁠

In general, scope will display the sum of estimates applied to an issue. This number can change based on the options selected in Settings > Team > General > Estimates, where you have the option to Count un-estimated issues so issues without estimates will be added to the total scope.

## Assign completed issues to previous cycles⁠

We allow for completed issues to be added to previous cycles to account for issues that were completed in the previous cycle, but wasn't marked as completed before the cycle closed.

## FAQ⁠

[](https://linear.app/docs/cycle-graph#collapsible-db8964e70f43)The overall Cycle Success is calculated based on the percentage of issues completed or started during a cycle. Completed issues are fully counted, while started issues are counted as 25% done.

For an example cycle with 10 issues, where 5 are completed, 4 are started and 1 is untouched, you will see 60% cycle success (50% for the completed issues, 10% for the 4 started issues)
