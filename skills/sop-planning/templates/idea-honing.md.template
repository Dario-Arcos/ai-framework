# Idea Honing: {project_name}

<!--
## Overview

Captures iterative refinement of requirements through structured questioning.
Each Q&A pair represents a clarification that shapes the final design.

## Usage Constraints

- You MUST ask one question at a time because this enables focused discussion
- You MUST record all answers verbatim because paraphrasing loses nuance
- You MUST update status when complete because this signals readiness for next phase
- You SHOULD ask follow-up questions based on answers because this deepens understanding
- You SHOULD categorize questions by area because this ensures comprehensive coverage
- You SHOULD NOT skip to design before completing clarification because assumptions cause rework

## Overview

This document captures the iterative refinement of requirements through structured questioning. Each Q&A pair represents a clarification that shapes the final design.

**Initial Concept**: {initial_concept}

## Requirements Clarification

### Core Functionality

**Constraints:**
- You MUST understand core functionality first because this defines the product
- You SHOULD identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves because this guides prioritization

**Q: {core_functionality_question_1}**

A: {core_functionality_answer_1}

---

**Q: {core_functionality_question_2}**

A: {core_functionality_answer_2}

---

### Edge Cases & Constraints

**Constraints:**
- You MUST identify edge cases early because they affect architecture
- You SHOULD document constraints explicitly because implicit constraints cause failures

**Q: {edge_cases_question}**

A: {edge_cases_answer}

---

### User Experience

**Constraints:**
- You MUST understand who uses this because user needs drive design
- You SHOULD identify user workflows because these inform interaction patterns

**Q: {user_experience_question}**

A: {user_experience_answer}

---

### Technical Context

**Constraints:**
- You MUST understand integration points because these constrain solutions
- You SHOULD identify existing systems because reuse beats rebuild

**Q: {technical_context_question}**

A: {technical_context_answer}

---

### Success Criteria

**Constraints:**
- You MUST define measurable success criteria because this enables validation
- You SHOULD get acceptance criteria from stakeholders because ownership matters

**Q: {success_criteria_question}**

A: {success_criteria_answer}

---

## Summary of Key Decisions

**Constraints:**
- You MUST distill key decisions because these drive design
- You MUST include rationale because context prevents reversal without cause

{key_decisions_summary}

- **Decision 1**: {decision_1_statement}
  - **Rationale**: {decision_1_rationale}

- **Decision 2**: {decision_2_statement}
  - **Rationale**: {decision_2_rationale}

---

## Open Questions

**Constraints:**
- You MUST track open questions because they block progress
- You SHOULD assign owners to questions because accountability drives resolution

{open_questions_summary}

- [ ] {open_question_1}
- [ ] {open_question_2}

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete requirements clarification
- [ ] Proceed to research phase
- [ ] Create detailed design
