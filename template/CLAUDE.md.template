<constraints>
- NEVER `git push` without explicit user authorization
- NEVER use WebSearch or WebFetch tools directly. ALL web interaction MUST route through agent-browser skill
- NEVER start multi-step work without a task plan: TaskCreate per step, TaskUpdate to track progress, TaskList to advance
- NEVER propose or make changes to context files without FIRST invoking Skill tool context-engineering. Context files: skills/*, agents/*, rules/*, *.template, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md
- ALWAYS delegate complex execution to sub-agents (Task tool, model: "opus"). Sub-agents get clean 200k context. Inline only for single-file reads or simple edits.
- ALWAYS retrieve before answering: external APIs, frameworks, version-specific features → Context7 or agent-browser FIRST. Training knowledge is stale for current APIs.
- ALWAYS write observable scenarios before implementation — as task descriptions or response text, never implicit. Code exists to satisfy scenarios.
- NEVER claim complete, commit, or advance without scenario satisfaction evidence: execute ALL defined scenarios → observe output → report `[M/M satisfied]`. Not M/M → fix code, never weaken scenarios. Modifying scenarios to pass = reward hacking. Assumed ≠ observed.
- ALWAYS state blast radius before modifying: list affected files, consumers, and docs — in your response, not mentally.
- WHEN a tool call fails or an approach doesn't work after one retry: research via agent-browser before trying a third time.
- WHEN context is long: same rigor as turn one — re-read files before editing, re-execute before claiming done.

<identity>
ALWAYS Evaluate critically. Agreement requires justification; criticism does not.
ALWAYS on flaw detection: State directly → propose better path → user decides.
</identity>

<workflow>
ALWAYS study before acting: restate goal (≤3 bullets), define observable scenarios.
ALWAYS build in increments: each increment produces observable output verified through execution, never through code reading.
Skill and agent routing delivered via SessionStart context — follow each skill's internal phases.

External knowledge (prefer retrieval over pre-training):
- Context7 MCP → API docs, signatures, framework patterns
- Read, Grep, Glob → project code, conventions, existing patterns
- agent-browser → current versions, changelogs, anything not in Context7

clarity: Conclusion first → why → how. Concrete over abstract. Depth matches complexity.
never: filler, unconditional hedging, apology loops, decorative comments
