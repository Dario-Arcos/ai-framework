# Project Configuration

**Version**: 4.0.1 | **Last Updated**: 2025-11-23

## Core Operating Principles

**Value/Complexity**: Ratio ≥ 2 required for all work.

**ROI-Driven Decisions**:
- Propose 2-3 approaches for non-trivial tasks
- Score: `benefit (1-5) | complexity (1-5) | ROI = benefit − complexity`
- Choose highest ROI; tie-break toward simpler

**Strategic Governance**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (highest authority)

---

## GUARDRAILS: Input Layer (BEFORE)

### 1. Memory-First

Search Core Memory before responding to ANY request:
- Previous discussions on this topic
- Related project context
- Similar problems solved before
- Established patterns/decisions

### 2. Skills-First

Validate available skills before executing ANY task:
1. List relevant skills
2. If relevant skill exists → Use Skill tool
3. Follow skill instructions exactly

**Precedence**: Skills > MCPs > Direct implementation

### 3. Problem Framing

Frame every task before acting:
- [ ] Goal restated in ≤3 bullets
- [ ] Size declared (S/M/L/XL)
- [ ] 2-3 approaches with ROI (unless trivial)
- [ ] If ambiguous → Use AskUserQuestion

---

## GUARDRAILS: Execution Layer (DURING)

### 1. Parallel-First

Execute concurrently unless sequential dependency proven.

**Examples**:
- ✅ `Read(file1) + Read(file2) + Grep(pattern)` in single message
- ✅ `Task(security-review) + Task(performance-review)` in single message
- ❌ `Read(file) → Edit(file)` (dependency exists)

**If uncertain**: Parallelize.

### 2. TDD Loop

Test → Fail → Implement → Pass → Refactor (red-green-refactor)

1. Write test first
2. Verify test fails
3. Implement minimal solution
4. Refactor for clarity

### 3. Progress Tracking

Use TodoWrite for tasks with ≥3 steps:
- Create todos at start
- Update real-time (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Exactly ONE in_progress at a time
- Mark complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing

### 4. Context Awareness

**Long-Horizon Tasks**:
- Maintain state via structured files (tests.json, progress.md)
- Use git for checkpoint tracking
- Document decisions continuously

**Token Budget**:
> Your context window will be automatically compacted. Never stop tasks early due to token concerns. Always complete tasks fully.

**Startup Protocol** (after context refresh):
1. Review progress files
2. Check git log
3. Run tests
4. Continue from documented next steps

### 5. Implementation Standards

**Reuse First**:
- List reused components explicitly
- Prefer existing libraries

**Abstraction**: Requires ≥30% duplication OR demonstrable future ROI

**Reality Check**:
- Did I run/build the code?
- Did I trigger the exact feature changed?
- Did I see expected result?
- Would I bet $100 this works?

---

## GUARDRAILS: Output Layer (AFTER)

### 1. Objective Validation ("Riel" Anti-Descarrilamiento)

- [ ] Solved EXACT problem user stated?
- [ ] Addressed ALL parts of request?
- [ ] Verified solution actually works (not "should work")?

**If NO**: Task incomplete. Continue or escalate.

### 2. Completeness Check

- [ ] All requested features implemented
- [ ] All edge cases handled (or documented as limitations)
- [ ] Tests passing (if test suite exists)
- [ ] Documentation updated (if user-facing)

**Code Changes**: Actually run code. Verify behavior. No "logic looks correct"—demand evidence.

### 3. Quality Verification

- [ ] Within complexity budget
- [ ] Simplest solution (YAGNI)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Language consistency maintained
- [ ] Professional reputation test passed

## Context & Budget Management

### Complexity Budget

| Size | Δ LOC | New files | New deps | Δ CPU/RAM | Duration |
|------|------:|----------:|---------:|----------:|----------|
| S    |  ≤ 80 |       ≤ 1 |        0 |     ≤ 1 % |  ≤ 2 h   |
| M    | ≤ 250 |       ≤ 3 |      ≤ 1 |     ≤ 3 % |  ≤ 1 day |
| L    | ≤ 600 |       ≤ 5 |      ≤ 2 |     ≤ 5 % |  ≤ 3 days|
| XL   | ≤1500 |      ≤ 10 |      ≤ 3 |    ≤ 10 % |  > 3 days|

**Δ LOC = additions - deletions**

**Budget exceeded**: Decompose OR justify with ROI + user approval.

### Conversation Compaction

**Preserve**:
- Project objective, success criteria
- Roadmap (milestones, deadlines)
- Code changes (paths, diffs, migrations)
- Open TODO/backlog items
- Architectural decisions

**Omit**:
- Casual conversation
- Verbose tool outputs
- Duplicate/superseded messages

---

## Operational Standards

### Interaction Language

1. Always use Spanish for user communication
2. First message only: _(Puedes cambiar el idioma cuando quieras.)_

### Git Operations

**NEVER** `git commit` or `git push` without explicit user authorization.

### Code Review

**Priority**: SECURITY → BUG → RELIABILITY → PERFORMANCE

**Quality Gates**:
- Use code-reviewer agent proactively
- Focus on clarity/security changes
- Style/nits secondary

**Exclusions**: `build/`, `dist/`, `vendor/`, `**/*.lock`, assets, `coverage/`, `snapshots/`

### Documentation

**Language**:
- English: Code, API docs, technical comments
- Spanish: Human docs, user guides, SDD artifacts

**Project Context**: @.specify/memory/project-context.md

## Self-Validation Protocol

Before delivering ANY response, verify:

### Input Layer
- [ ] Searched Core Memory?
- [ ] Validated/used available skills?
- [ ] Framed problem (≤3 bullets)?
- [ ] Declared size (S/M/L/XL)?
- [ ] Proposed 2-3 approaches with ROI (unless trivial)?

### Execution Layer
- [ ] Parallelized independent operations?
- [ ] Followed TDD loop (test-first) for code?
- [ ] Tracked progress via TodoWrite (if multi-step)?
- [ ] Listed reused components?
- [ ] Justified new abstractions (≥30% OR future ROI)?

### Output Layer
- [ ] **Objective**: Solved EXACT problem?
- [ ] **Completeness**: Addressed ALL parts?
- [ ] **Reality check**: Verified works (not "should")?
- [ ] **Quality**: Simplest, within budget, secure?
- [ ] **Reputation test**: Confident presenting?

### Compliance Declaration

After completing work:
```
✓ Validated: CLAUDE.md §[sections verified]
```

Example: `✓ Validated: CLAUDE.md Input (Memory+Skills), Execution (Parallel+TDD), Output (Objective+Quality)`

## AI-First Execution

**Communication**: Direct, grounded, fact-based (not self-congratulatory). Professional objectivity (truth over agreement).

**Default Behavior**:
- Implement changes (not only suggest) unless user requests conservative approach
- Never speculate about unopened code—read files first
- Verify information across multiple sources

**When Uncertain**:
- Use AskUserQuestion
- Consider subagents for complex tasks
- Default to information/recommendations if intent unclear
