# Architecture

## Entry Points
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → plugin registration (Claude Code loads agents/, skills/, hooks/)
- `hooks/hooks.json` → lifecycle triggers (SessionStart, Stop, Notification, TeammateIdle, TaskCompleted, PreToolUse, PostToolUse)

## Layers
```
agents/           # Specialized reasoning modules (.md files, auto-delegated)
skills/           # Workflow commands (each self-contained: SKILL.md + references/)
hooks/            # Lifecycle automation (Python + Shell, triggered by hooks.json)
template/         # Distributed to target projects on install (.claude/, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore)
human-handbook/   # VitePress documentation site (not runtime code)
scripts/          # Build utilities (sync-versions.cjs)
.claude/          # Runtime config (settings.json, statusline.sh)
.claude-plugin/   # Plugin manifest (plugin.json)
```

## Boundaries
- Skills are fully isolated: each skill directory is self-contained, never imports from other skills
- Agents are stateless single-file definitions: receive context via git diff/status, return findings
- Hooks may share private modules within hooks/ (underscore-prefixed), but never import from skills or agents
- template/ is write-only distribution: copied to target projects, never imported back

## Data Flow
```
SessionStart → hooks (sync templates, check browser, check memory)
  → User invokes /skill-name or agent auto-delegates
  → Skill SKILL.md loaded → execution (may spawn subagents)
  → PreToolUse (Edit|Write) → sdd-test-guard validates test integrity
  → PostToolUse (Edit|Write) → sdd-auto-test runs tests in background, reports state
  → TeammateIdle → leader assigns new work or shuts down teammate
  → TaskCompleted → agent validates output
  → SessionStop → notify.sh
```

## API Type
None (plugin framework — no HTTP/CLI endpoints)
