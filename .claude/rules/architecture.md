# Architecture

## Entry Points
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → plugin registration (Claude Code loads agents/, skills/, hooks/)
- `hooks/hooks.json` → lifecycle triggers (SessionStart, Stop, Notification)
- `CLAUDE.md` → operating directives loaded every session

## Layers
```
agents/           # Specialized reasoning modules (6 .md files, auto-delegated)
skills/           # Workflow commands (25 dirs, each self-contained: SKILL.md + references/)
hooks/            # Lifecycle automation (Python + Shell, triggered by hooks.json)
template/         # Distributed to target projects on install (.claude/, CLAUDE.md, .gitignore)
human-handbook/   # VitePress documentation site (not runtime code)
scripts/          # Build utilities (sync-versions.cjs)
.claude/          # Runtime config (settings.json, statusline.sh)
.claude-plugin/   # Plugin manifest (plugin.json)
```

## Boundaries
- Skills are fully isolated: each skill directory is self-contained, never imports from other skills
- Agents are stateless single-file definitions: receive context via git diff/status, return findings
- Hooks execute external processes (Python/Shell): no shared state with skills or agents
- template/ is write-only distribution: copied to target projects, never imported back

## Data Flow
```
SessionStart → hooks (sync templates, inject skill enforcement, check browser)
  → User invokes /skill-name or agent auto-delegates
  → Skill SKILL.md loaded → execution (may spawn subagents)
  → Agent validates output (code-reviewer, security-reviewer)
  → SessionStop → notify.sh
```

## API Type
None (plugin framework — no HTTP/CLI endpoints)
