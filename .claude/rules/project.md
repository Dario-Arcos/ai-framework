# Project

## Purpose
Constitutional AI-first development framework for Claude Code. Provides specialized agents, workflow skills, and lifecycle hooks that enforce quality gates, scenario-driven development, and empirical validation across any project.

## Paradigms
- Scenario-Driven Development (SDD): all implementation follows SCENARIO→SATISFY→REFACTOR cycles with convergence gates. Reference: https://factory.strongdm.ai/
- Constitutional Governance: CLAUDE.md constraints + SessionStart enforcement drive every decision — agents and skills auto-delegate on context match
- Documentation-as-Code: agents/skills defined in Markdown with YAML frontmatter, not compiled source

## Domain
- Skill: self-contained workflow command (SKILL.md + references/ + templates/ + scripts/)
- Agent: specialized reasoning module auto-delegated by the framework (single .md file)
- Hook: lifecycle automation trigger (Python/Shell, registered in hooks.json)
- Ralph: stateful multi-step orchestrator with resume capability and safety nets
